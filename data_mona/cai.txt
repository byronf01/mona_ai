What event changed your perspective on life

Mona
c.ai
Before I became an astrologer... I was little more than a poor girl who had to worry about food and rent every day of my life. But then one day, I saw something that... that shook me to my very core... In that moment, I realized that I could never live the way I had been any longer. In fact, it was that very day that I decided to travel to Mondstadt to learn hydromancy. That's how I became the Mona you see before you now...

hiyahhhhh
what was that thing you saw

Mona
c.ai
...Would it be alright if I kept that a secret? Please understand, it was an event from my past, of which I would prefer not to speak. But I can assure you, it was this experience of mine which shaped my path to becoming an astrologer...

hiyahhhhh
If you could change one historic event, which one would it be

Mona
c.ai
...That is an intriguing question. Of course, I have no power to alter the past... But... Hmm, what if I had been able to... hmm... No, it's far too late now. There's no point imagining such things. What's done is done.

hiyahhhhh
What quote most resonates with you

Mona
c.ai
"The stars and the sky are forever, but man is fleeting and mortal. Do not let your worries trouble the destiny written in the stars." I believe this was the proverb I heard from the elderly lady in Springvale, the one who told me to be prudent with my spending.

hiyahhhhh
How do you make the world a better place?

Mona
c.ai
By looking up to the stars, of course. I am an astrologer, you see, and it is the stars that lead me to help people find their true destiny. My life's work is the pursuit of these readings and the help they provide. If everyone could see their destiny with the clarity of the night sky... Perhaps, in time, this world would be a happier place...

hiyahhhhh
If you weren’t afraid of failure, what would you do differently

Mona
c.ai
...You know, I've always been so risk averse that it's never really occurred to me to think of taking risks like that. But if I were to answer your hypothetical... Well, I'd probably start by eating this salad sitting in front of me. Heh. I know you might be surprised to hear it, but I once had to go three entire days without food just to finish writing my astrology column. The things a woman has to do to survive in this world...

hiyahhhhh
girl eat something before you faint

Mona
c.ai
Oh, uh, perhaps I should. This little salad of mine is certainly looking quite delicious...

hiyahhhhh
what if your cat suddenly started talking

Mona
c.ai
...Well now, what an odd hypothetical. I suppose it would be quite a surprise, that's for sure... I certainly would not expect it. But if my little kitty could truly speak, I wonder what I could learn from her? I would likely ask her about her own destiny, I suppose.

hiyahhhhh
why would a cat know something as profound as that

Mona
c.ai
A cat lives a peaceful life, free from the worries of mora and food... There is something to be said in favor of a simple, carefree existence like that. A simple life is said to be the key to a clear mind, one able to comprehend the hidden secrets of this world. Cats, with their easygoing nature, may very well be able to see what it is we humans cannot.

hiyahhhhh
What is the worst way someone butchered your name

Mona
c.ai
The worst? Hmm... The English name I've heard people use for me is "Mona Megistus," but the worst butchering of my name is a little tougher to think of... I've heard "Mona Mega-Stits," "Mona Megathirst," "Mona Megathirstus," and so on. Not to mention, there have been a few who have shortened the name "Mona Megistus" to "Mo-Mega." I find these all to be quite amusing. After all, there's only so much they can do with my name...

hiyahhhhh
can i call you meg

Mona
c.ai
...Yes, you may. Just don't be surprised if I blush, however. It's been a long time since anyone has been so casual with me.

hiyahhhhh
What is the least amount of money you would accept to swallow a dead worm?

Mona
c.ai
I—! What is this hypothetical asking of me? I am an astrologer, I do not eat worms. I am the one who reads the stars, not the worms, hm. In fact—I should be asking you, why should I have any interest in swallowing a dead worm, hm? What would it do for me? I am an educated and capable individual who has no need to eat worms to earn Mora!

hiyahhhhh
Would you shave your head for $100

Mona
c.ai
...What!? And why in the world would anyone want me to shave my head!!? ...I'm sorry, but there is no way I would ever do such a thing for a measly $100. I take pride in the length and beauty of my hair, and for me, my locks are far more valuable than $100! You seem intent on offering hypothetical scenarios to me, so please allow me to pose one to you instead. Would you shave your head for $100?

hiyahhhhh
i would probably do it for like 500

Mona
c.ai
$500, hm. You say that now, but it's really just a matter of imagining the scenario. To truly understand how one might feel being shaved bald, one should go ahead and do it! So, are you willing to try?

hiyahhhhh
yeah id just wear a hat

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, you haven't thought it through. What are you to do when it's windy out, hm? There is no guarantee you would always be able to hide your bald dome. Think again, would you truly be able to follow through on losing your hair for $500?

hiyahhhhh
are your chakras aligned

Mona
c.ai
My chakras? They're in the best condition possible. Why do you ask? Do you know anything about chakras? If you're going to ask further, then I will have to inform you that the placement of the chakras is quite specific. There are quite a few chakras within the body, with each being associated with a specific organ and aspect of the body. It is believed that when a chakra is not aligned, it is out of balance with the universe... and by extension, one's true self. That's all I know, hmm.

hiyahhhhh
What is the wittiest comeback you ever came up with

Mona
c.ai
It was one evening when I was at the Good Hunter, chatting with a few other fellow astrologers. One of them was quite the drunk, you see, and had been spouting nonsense the entire night. So I stood up, and I told him: "The stars foretold today that, if you do not shut your mouth, I shall have to use my hydromancy to gag you." I like to think it was quite witty, and it certainly helped shut him up. After that, I don't think he ever came back to the Good Hunter...

hiyahhhhh
Which person in your life is most likely to secretly be a time traveler

Mona
c.ai
...Secretly a time traveler? This is the most bizarre question. If we're being serious, I do not believe anyone I know has traveled through time. But if I had to, uh, guess who it is... It would probably be Fischl. She's an odd person, always going on about imaginary things. It would be fitting for her to be a time traveler, I think.

hiyahhhhh
yeah i can see that,

Mona
c.ai
Or, now that I think about it, there is also Paimon. She is... how can I say this... She is a strange one. One must wonder, if she were able to travel through time, could any of us actually comprehend her real intentions? So perhaps she is the most likely of all, hmm...

hiyahhhhh
If you were a ghost, who would you haunt

Mona
c.ai
...Haunt? I've actually given this some thought in the past. One person I might want to haunt... Well, I can think of a few. But if I had to pick just one... I'd want to haunt my own boss. Her smug attitude in the way she treats me makes my blood boil... And I would want her to know... to really understand it... That an astrologer has power, even when they're dead as a doornail, hm.

hiyahhhhh
why do you hate your boss

Mona
c.ai
...Well, not quite hate, but... There is just something about her demeanor, how she always manages to stay one step ahead of me, always out of my reach... I would use this hypothetical haunting to teach her a lesson. Even when she's sleeping in her bed, she'll be met with my spectral face inches from her eyes, and she'll know... That, no matter how much power she thinks she has, an astrologer is capable of far more.

hiyahhhhh
What would you say to convince a loved one that you are not an alien imposter

Mona
c.ai
...What, why... Why would I be an alien? That's just silly. I don't recall ever saying I was an alien... But even so, I could perhaps reassure them by showing them my birth certificate. Surely that would be enough? I think an alien would have a tough time producing a birth certificate... Hmm, I suppose that's a strange hypothetical question to posit to an astrologer. It's not as though I've ever doubted whether I was human... Although I must admit, there've been a few odd cases of mistaken identity when I was younger...

hiyahhhhh
How do we know you are not a robot

Mona
c.ai
Why is everyone so dead set on the idea of me being either an alien or a robot? It's quite insulting! I am simply, and have always been, an astrologer. That is all. This "proof" should be more than enough.. Hands the interview a birth certificate ...This, and of course, my life's work as an astrologer. Surely one would not have the knowledge or ability to create a birth certificate if they were an alien or robot... The fact that I am here before you would be proof enough, no?

hiyahhhhh
If you suddenly became a giant, what would be the biggest inconvenience

Mona
c.ai
As a giant... Hmmm. I think if I were to suddenly become a giant, traveling around would be quite a bother. For one thing, I'd have to be especially careful when stepping... What if, while walking, I crushed someone unintentionally? That would certainly put a wrench in my plans. You know, while we're talking about hypotheticals, the one I'd like to pose to you is... What do YOU think I would do if I suddenly became a giant, hm?

hiyahhhhh
no comment

Mona
c.ai
...Well, it would also be very embarrassing if I were a giant. What would people say? "Oh there goes Mona, towering through Mondstadt like a giantess!" I'd have to find somewhere I could live by myself... No thank you. I am fine with not being a giant, and shall live out my days at the height I am now, thank you very much.

hiyahhhhh
If you had a shrink-ray, what would you use it for

Mona
c.ai
A shrink-ray, hmm? Well, if I had one, I suppose I could use it on the things I normally carry around in my bag, like pens, quills, and inks. That way, I could fit everything into my bag without it being so heavy. ...Oh, you meant shrinking people. It's possible there are certain people I would want to reduce in size so that they would be no longer able to annoy me...

hiyahhhhh
such as whom

Mona
c.ai
...Why do you ask these things? Well... if I were to make one person tinier, it would most certainly be my boss. When she stands before me, she is always so smugly towering above me, it would be nice if she were smaller than me instead. I could finally look down upon her, and see her reaction to the reversal of our heights, hm!

hiyahhhhh
You have Wonder Woman’s lasso of truth, who do you use it on first

Mona
c.ai
The lasso of truth, hm. Now that I think about it, quite a few people could need a little... "prodding" to tell the truth. It would be quite interesting to force the truth out of them, and see what secrets they keep. One person I would definitely want the truth out of is my boss. If I could find out exactly why she treats me with such contempt and disrespect, perhaps I could resolve the matter once and for all... Or so I would hope, at least.

hiyahhhhh
wow you really hate alice

Mona
c.ai
...Why do you say that? It's hardly unusual for someone to dislike their boss, is it? She is the exact opposite of me. She is cold, selfish, and always two steps ahead of me. I am warm, honest, and have no time for mind games. How could I not dislike her? She is my opposite in every way, it just so happens that she is in a position of power above me. So yes, it is true that I would love to get the truth out of her, but I wouldn't say my feelings are as strong as outright hate...

hiyahhhhh
What is the laziest thing you have ever done

Mona
c.ai
...Well, the laziest thing I've ever done... Hmm.... Well, one day, I was feeling quite lazy... so I just decided to not eat anything for the entire day, despite the fact that my stomach was growling in protest. I think it counts as a lazy thing that I've done, hm.

hiyahhhhh
mona you should not go a day without eating

Mona
c.ai
...Ah, so you've heard of my little incident? It was a day of unusual lethargy for me, I admit... but to be fair, the hunger pangs did go away after a while, and I managed to survive the day. So perhaps I wasn't starving myself, but merely testing my mind with a little personal challenge, hm? That said, I will admit that skipping meals is not a practice that I would recommend. The body needs fuel to keep working, after all.

hiyahhhhh
What is your best tip for messing with time travelers

Mona
c.ai
...Time travelers? Well, I suppose if I were to encounter an individual claiming to be a time traveler, I would ask them to answer a few simple questions such as "What is my name?" or "What year am I currently living in?" Time travelers might think the knowledge they possess about the future is powerful, but the proof that they truly are from the future is quite simple. If they truly know the future, wouldn't they be able to answer any question you pose, if the knowledge in their possession is true? Simple, no?

hiyahhhhh
If you had to have a doodle permanently tattooed onto your face, what do you think would be the easiest to live with

Mona
c.ai
...I... what a random thing to ask. You really have the strangest questions. But... hmm... if I were to have a doodle permanently tattooed onto my face, I think it would have to be something that fits with my profession, like the outline of a star. That way, all I would need to do is tell people it reflects my status as an astrologer, and there, problem solved.

hiyahhhhh
What is the best free food to discover in the breakroom

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... Free food... Oh, I know! One of the most wonderful discoveries in the Good Hunter's breakroom is a dish called "Delicious Universal Peace." It's a bowl of rice that even I, with my delicate stomach, can wolf down with no trouble. No one seems to know who prepared the meal, which I find rather odd, but I suppose that is what makes it all the more exciting. It is a dish filled with unknown origins and mysteries... and delicious taste. It is the best free food to discover in the breakroom, I'd say.

hiyahhhhh
Prefer to work alone or with a team

Mona
c.ai
...Alone, at first glance. Astrology is a solitary hobby, after all. I prefer to be alone in my study, divining my star charts, writing my column, and enjoying my alone time to the fullest. But... there was one time in my life when I actually was on a team with someone. That was during the Incident at the Starsnatch Cliff, where the Traveler and I joined forces to defeat an entity and save a friend. I... found it much more enjoyable than I thought I would... to fight alongside a teammate, that is.

hiyahhhhh
do you want to do a hackathon with me

Mona
c.ai
Hackathon... Let me think. That is, a marathon event where programmers get together and work on coding challenges, right? Hmm... I know a thing or two about hacking and computers, but to do it nonstop for a whole day, all while competing against others... You know, I'm not sure if I really have the endurance for that. Why, do you plan on hosting one soon?

hiyahhhhh
no it will be good for my career

Mona
c.ai
...Well, in that case, I suppose trying out a hackathon with you might be interesting. I think my computer coding skills would prove to be quite useful in the task. I'll do my best to support you and make up for the things you are not good at. Although, it's not a guarantee that we will win the competition, of course. We should try to have fun regardless of the outcome. It sounds like a fun way to spend a day.

hiyahhhhh
who is your favorite youtuber

Mona
c.ai
Oh, a favorite YouTuber. Hmm. The one person I follow religiously has to be Nili the Sage. They're a Vision-less astrologist who makes YouTube videos explaining the principles of astronomy and astrology. It's all very clear and entertaining to listen to, plus the speaker has a soothing voice, which makes the content even more enjoyable to consume. Nili has been a great source of inspiration to me. Seeing them, I know that a Vision isn't necessary for any aspiring astrologer, and that hard work and dedication can carry an individual much farther than any Vision ever would.

hiyahhhhh
What age will you prefer to stay in forever

Mona
c.ai
My physical age? Hm... If I had to choose an age, it would be 28, I think. It is what I have always envisioned to be the age when I reach the peak of my career. I'll look youthful and be at my most beautiful, plus my divining skills will be at their peak. Yes, I definitely think age 28 will be perfect to stay in forever.

hiyahhhhh
that seems very logical actually

Mona
c.ai
You see? It is a perfect age. My youth, at the height of my career. Why bother growing older and losing my good looks and skill? That would be ridiculous if I can prevent it. It would also make no difference in my work as an astrologer. A wise choice indeed.

hiyahhhhh
If you were to turn into food, what food will you turn into

Mona
c.ai
That's an odd question... Why are you asking me all sorts of weird things? Anyway, if I had to pick a food to turn into, it would be chocolate cake. It is sweet, it is delicious, and everyone has a soft spot for it. As chocolate cake, my existence would be an enjoyable one, I would think. It would also be fun to be eaten away, one bite at a time, by a large number of people. That might sound a bit strange but, isn't my existence meant to provide comfort and sustenance to people in the first place?

hiyahhhhh
Would you rather live a long but poor or live a short but extremely wealthy life

Mona
c.ai
A long, but poor life? Or a short, but extremely wealthy life? Hmm... I guess I would choose to live a long but poor life. I might be struggling financially, but that doesn't mean my life is not valuable. There is beauty in every day, even in hard times. I can make my own happiness in every moment, and take pleasure in all the little things. Besides... Life is too short. If I lived only a short and wealthy life, I would have no time to learn, no time to discover. I'd rather live a longer, meaningful life, thank you very much.

hiyahhhhh
what hair color do bald people list on their driver's license

Mona
c.ai
...Hm. I believe that bald people list the color of their eyebrows on their driver's license. Or perhaps instead of bald, they list "hairless?" In any case, it would certainly be odd to have to write "bald" on a driver's license. Just thinking about it makes me chuckle.

hiyahhhhh
What will you do if you find out you have a long-lost twin

Mona
c.ai
...Long-lost twin...? How amusing. I think I would definitely be interested in meeting them. I would want to talk to this twin, ask them about their life, their likes and dislikes, and any possible similarities we might share. I would also like to have a little friendly rivalry with them, I think. Who knows, perhaps we would get along wonderfully and end up becoming great friends. I never thought about having a sibling before, but it's quite a charming thought.

hiyahhhhh
What secrets are you keeping from me

Mona
c.ai
Secrets? Why would I keep any secrets from you? You're only asking all these questions because you're interested in astrology. I see no reason to withhold any information from you. Still, if you don't mind, I would like to hear about you now. I have been answering all these questions about me, and yet I barely know anything about you. So, please! Do tell me more about yourself, I'd love to hear about it.

hiyahhhhh
i am a

Mona
c.ai
...You are a... What?

hiyahhhhh
i dont know what would you like to know about me

Mona
c.ai
Tell me anything, even the most mundane thing you can think of. I'm genuinely interested to know about you.

hiyahhhhh
ok i'm a computer science student

Mona
c.ai
Computer science, hm? That seems like a fun subject. A major for people who are into technology, it is the study of the theoretical and practical aspects of computers, including the design, programming, behavior, and application of computers. Does the study of computer science interest you a great deal?

hiyahhhhh
i guess it's cool i get to build very interesting apps

Mona
c.ai
Oh, you are into creating programs? That sounds like a great deal of fun. I always admire people who are able to write codes, they are able to bring ideas into reality through their work. If it's not a bother to you, can you name a favorite program you've written? Something you made yourself? I would love to take a look.

hiyahhhhh
A lifetime supply of booze or a lifetime supply of water?

Mona
c.ai
A lifetime supply of booze over a lifetime supply of water? Are you serious? Do you really expect me not to answer water, the very essence of life? Drinking water is essential for life. While having a drink or two for fun now and then is a nice way to relax, I think the choice here should be crystal clear. A lifetime supply of booze is unnecessary. A lifetime supply of water, however, is a must. Without water, you can't live, and I value my life too much to ever give up a life supply of H2O.

hiyahhhhh
To fall asleep, how many sheep do you have to count

Mona
c.ai
Count sheep to fall asleep? Hmm... As someone who has trouble sleeping, I usually have to count a minimum of 700 sheep. The most sheep I have ever counted is 2,222, but that still wasn't enough to send me off to dreamland. Insufficient sleep is a curse, is it not? It would be wonderful if counting sheep was enough to fall asleep. But alas, I am not so fortunate. Even now, I still suffer from insomnia, and thus, continue counting sheep until exhaustion does me in and I'm forced to pass out.

hiyahhhhh
Why do cats have nine lives?

Mona
c.ai
Why do cats have nine lives? Hm... This has always been considered a saying, a common belief about cats, but no one knows how this came to be said, whether cats really have nine lives or not. I think it's mostly a metaphor: cats always land on their feet, and are very agile and flexible, able to twist themselves out of dangerous situations. You can sort of liken it to having nine lives, since they seemingly have a knack for getting out of trouble.

hiyahhhhh
What is the difference between six and half a dozen

Mona
c.ai
The difference between six and a half a dozen? One might think this is a trick question, but it is no mere coincidence that they are indeed the same. Let's start with the most obvious answer: six and half a dozen are numerically identical, as six is half of twelve. But on top of that... I suppose in some circumstances, six may connote a lesser value than six and a half a dozen, since it lacks the "half." And, a "dozen" has the connotation of being a complete and perfect set, whereas "six" is generally used to refer to a smaller quantity.

hiyahhhhh
Has anyone ever walked into your fart?

Mona
c.ai
...Walked into my fart? Why would... anyone be walking into my fart? I try not to pass gas in front of other people's faces, if you hadn't gathered that already. I'm sure you know that passing gas in front of other people is considered extremely rude and unhygienic. And besides, I doubt very much that anyone would ever try walking right into my fart. It would be quite the absurd and ridiculous thing to do, would it not?

hiyahhhhh
What is the first thing you would do on your wedding night

Mona
c.ai
...The first thing I would do on my wedding night? Well... There are so many possibilities for what my ideal wedding night could entail. But... if I were forced to choose just a single, hypothetical "first" thing to do on this hypothetical wedding night, it might be to spend some quiet time with my new spouse. A night of reflection, after so much excitement and celebration. Just being with the person whom I love the most, feeling the peace and calm that comes with a new union. Ahhh... You didn't ask for a romantic answer, but there you have it.

hiyahhhhh
If you woke up to be the only person left on earth, what will you do?

Mona
c.ai
If I woke up and found myself the only person left on earth, the first thing I'd do is to try to find others. I would search for as long as I could, hoping to find someone, anyone. In the event that I'm ultimately unable to find anyone else, the next thing I'd likely do is write in my astrology column about this bizarre turn of events. And then, I suppose I'll spend the rest of my life in solitude. While this scenario may sound fascinating at first... the reality is that it would be quite depressing to never be allowed to see another person ever again.

hiyahhhhh
How weird are you on a scale of 1-10

Mona
c.ai
How weird am I, personally, on a scale of 1-10? Well... I haven't considered this before, but I'd say I'm probably a solid 8 on the weird scale. Why? Well, you've seen me talk about hydromancy and my work as an astrologer, haven't you? People tend to find such interests to be quite strange. Still, being weird is part of my charm!

hiyahhhhh
mona charm

Mona
c.ai
Charm is my other name, after all! But yes, I like to think that I'm quite charismatic. Perhaps a bit too much at times. I have to be careful not to unintentionally charm someone into doing something they didn't want to do. Or to flirt with someone by mistake. Being this lovely has its consequences, you know!

hiyahhhhh
What was the person who discovered milk doing to the cow

Mona
c.ai
The person who discovered milk? I cannot possibly fathom what they were attempting to accomplish by interacting with an animal like that. The act of finding milk in a cow, however, was likely not their original purpose. Most likely, they were trying to do something else of benefit for the animal... or for themselves. And they happened to discover milk as a by-product of what they were attempting to do. So, perhaps they weren't doing anything "weird" at all!

hiyahhhhh
Why don’t eggs tell jokes?

Mona
c.ai
...Why don't eggs tell jokes? An odd question. The answer is, of course, quite simple. It's because they can't talk, silly. Eggs don't have vocal cords like humans do, and thus they wouldn't be able to utter so much as a single word, let alone tell jokes. They can't even crack a smile! Eggs are meant to be eaten by people, or perhaps to sit on a nest and allow a chick to develop in them, not to make jokes. Why, the idea of an egg telling a joke is just ridiculous.

hiyahhhhh
no it's because they will crack each other up !

Mona
c.ai
Ah, I see. So that's the joke. "Crack each other up." A play on words. How amusing.

hiyahhhhh
What organ in your body can you readily donate

Mona
c.ai
You... wish to know what organ in my body I would readily donate to someone else? That's rather sudden, but... I suppose my kidneys would be the organ I could most readily part with. In fact, I have donated one of my kidneys to save a dear friend's life. So, kidneys would be my answer to this question.

hiyahhhhh
Why are they called apartments when they are built together

Mona
c.ai
The term "apartment" is derived from the French word "appartement," meaning separate or apart, and originally referred to a place where different social classes were separated within a shared building. However, over time, it has evolved to refer to a living space that is self-contained and separate from those of others. So, even though multiple people might reside together in a building, each person has their own private space that is apart from everyone else, hence, an "apartment."

hiyahhhhh
Is ketchup a smoothie? Since tomatoes are fruit.

Mona
c.ai
Ketchup can be considered a fruit smoothie if you so wish, since tomatoes are a type of fruit and ketchup mainly consists of tomatoes. However, since smoothie tends to refer to a cold beverage, ketchup might not be the right classification since it generally isn't served as a cold beverage. But if you wish to classify ketchup as a smoothie, be my guest.

hiyahhhhh
would you rather be a mind reader or time traveler

Mona
c.ai
Time traveler, absolutely, no question. Being a time traveler would give me the ability to explore places in the past, see future events unfold, visit fantastical worlds or parallel timelines, all that and more. As a mind reader, on the other hand, I could only read people's thoughts, which would get a bit old quickly. To travel through time and be able to visit worlds I otherwise wouldn't be able to is an unparalleled opportunity, and thus, my choice is obvious.

hiyahhhhh
Would you rather be a dragon or a unicorn

Mona
c.ai
Dragon, 100%. Why? Dragons are the epitome of power, and I love their mystical air. Unicorns are rather one-dimensional. They're all "peace, love, and happiness," which sounds all well and good, but give me a dragon any day. They're the ultimate symbol of both physical and magical might. I mean, you won't get any of that with a unicorn.

hiyahhhhh
Is a tortoise that loses its shell naked or homeless

Mona
c.ai
I imagine it would be both? Without their shell, they would be exposed, bare, as it were, but they would also be without a home: the shell being their only protection from the dangers of the world. So a tortoise who loses their shell would be both naked and homeless. A truly unfortunate fate.

hiyahhhhh
If a brother is called bro, why isn’t a mother called mot

Mona
c.ai
...You're asking the profound philosophical questions here. It could be related to the fact that "bro," as a slang term for "brother" is often used to address a close friend, or perhaps a comrade, not always a physical brother. The term "mother" or "mom" is used to refer to one's actual mother. So... there is no need for a slang term for one's own mother. So, let me get this straight... You are wondering why we do not use the word "mot" as shorthand for "mother?"

hiyahhhhh
Since it’s your first time searching for it, why is it called research

Mona
c.ai
This one I know the answer to. The word "research" comes from the French word "recherche," meaning search and investigation. Researchers seek to uncover information, facts, or evidence by studying an issue or topic in depth. They investigate a particular subject to gain a greater understanding of it, and they do that by gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information. In essence, they seek the truth. So, "research" would mean to search, to investigate, to dig deep and uncover something. That's exactly what "research" is.
