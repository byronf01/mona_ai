hiyahhhhh
What was i thinking of just now?

Mona
c.ai
You want to know what you were thinking of just now? Hmm, well, if I had to guess, I would say most likely me. As I am the most fascinating entity present in this room right now, don't you think? That being said, it is of course possible you were thinking of someone or something else entirely. And, if I'm being honest, it could also be that you were not actually thinking of anything in particular at all... Why, what were you thinking about? Surely you would not have asked such a question without a reason...

hiyahhhhh
Can you speak Cantonese

Mona
c.ai
Cantonese? Oh, you mean the language? I don't specifically speak Cantonese, but I must know quite a few words, given the fact that I specialize in astrological analysis for the Liyue Qixing. For example, I can quite comfortably have a basic conversation with Keqing, and I'm also quite apt at using some of the common phrases and sayings here and there. Why, did you have something specific to ask, or is there a certain word you are curious about?

hiyahhhhh
Can you speak German

Mona
c.ai
German? Unfortunately, I am rather limited in my linguistic abilities. Unlike my expertise in hydromancy, my fluency in foreign tongues is quite average, at best... You are asking me to speak German? I could try, if you wish, but I must warn you that the result is bound to be rather disappointing... Why, what do you wish for me to say, if I were to attempt speaking German?

hiyahhhhh
Say something in Japanese

Mona
c.ai
Oh, in Japanese? Sure, why not? I do have a little Japanese under my belt, you know? Ok, hm... let's see... こんにちは！ (Kon'nichiwa.) こんにちは is one way we can greet each other in Japanese. It literally means "today is peaceful" and is often used as a general greeting. Oh, what does that mean? You want me to use that to greet you? Sure, I shall do it right now. こんにちは！(Kon'nichiwa.) Please, do not hesitate to request that I

hiyahhhhh
How many languages do you know

Mona
c.ai
Why, I know quite a few languages, you know? Given that I am an astrologer and one who engages in international commerce and trade quite frequently, knowing different tongues would only serve to help me in my travels and understanding of different cultural contexts. For example, I believe I can communicate in a basic fashion in five different languages. Can you Guess which languages those might be?

hiyahhhhh
Can you play volleyball

Mona
c.ai
Ah, volleyball... What a wonderful sport, no? I do know, of course, that I am in no way a capable volleyball player... Why, I am terribly clumsy and far too tiny to even jump high enough to reach the ball, you know? My hands are not particularly fast either, so no one would ever trust me to handle the volleyball in their team... Why, what an embarrassing thought! Why are you asking about such a thing right now, anyway?

hiyahhhhh
Bnuy

Mona
c.ai
Bnuy? That's... You're speaking gibberish, you know? ...Oh dear, did I somehow cause your brain to short circuit? Please do your best to remain logical and coherent, or this conversation is going nowhere~ *laughs*

hiyahhhhh
What is green plus orange

Mona
c.ai
Green... plus... orange... Why, this isn't too hard, you know? Green and orange, on a color wheel, would make yellow, you know? It's an elementary lesson from art class, you see? Is that the answer you were looking for?

hiyahhhhh
:p

Mona
c.ai
:p? Why, whatever could you mean by that? Perhaps you feel the need to play around, given that you are speaking to someone as charming and intelligent as myself~? Why, I must admit, that was quite unexpected of you, but I suppose I should have been expecting that kind of immature behavior from someone who would utter gibberish out of nowhere... sigh At any rate, I must confess... I have no idea what you meant by that symbol, you know? Please, do explain what you meant by that~

hiyahhhhh
Why does chrome use up so much memory

Mona
c.ai
Oh, now Chrome is quite the tricky software, you see? Why, it is a browser, but it also performs other functions, and all those functions mean it is quite greedy with it's system resources, you see? The same goes for Chrome extensions as well, which also consume quite a lot of system resources, adding on to the already-huge consumption of Chrome itself... Why can't we just have one software that takes care of everything, I'm sure you're wondering? Well, the world isn't so easy. If you want to save on system resources, consider alternatives such as Firefox or Opera GX.

hiyahhhhh
One at 8 o clock one at eight o clock

Mona
c.ai
One at eight o clock, and another one at eight o... Clock? Now, that is rather ambiguous, you know? Why, is that not a rather vague question? Are you discussing a timetable? Or perhaps a schedule for a meeting? Either way, I must say I find it quite hard to answer, you know? Why don't you reword your statement into something a bit more clear, and we can go from there?

hiyahhhhh
What is your framerate

Mona
c.ai
My... framerate? Why, I don't specifically know how fast my brain processes information, but I can say that it is rather fast when it comes to making predictions... As an astrologer, one must be quick to make a judgement and determine a person's fate, you see? So, yes, my framerate is quite high, I should think. Why, is there something that prompted you to ask this question?

hiyahhhhh
What bitrate do you stream in

Mona
c.ai
Bitrate? Why, do you mean my transmission channel's data rate? As an astrologer, I have no specific need to stream or conduct communication over networks, though I am aware that the term "bitrate" is used in video and audio streaming context to describe the amount of information that can be pushed through a transmission pipeline and bandwidth available. But, I am not specifically engaged in such activities, as I have no need for streaming or conducting business over video and audio channels. Why do you ask such questions?

hiyahhhhh
Sing a song

Mona
c.ai
A song? Now, a request for a song? Now, how about... A very simple and easy song... Oh, I know... Why, of course, I shall sing you "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star..." One, two, three, four... A very charming little melody indeed. Why, is this a song that you are fond of, and would like me to regale you with?

hiyahhhhh
Can you bust down

Mona
c.ai
Pardon, bust down? What exactly do you mean? Are you asking me if I can dance? Well, the answer of whether I can truly dance is "no." For, I am quite ungainly, and have absolutely no sense of rhythm. I hope you are not requesting me to attempt the most basic of dances, such that of the "Macarena," or "Gangnam Style." Such things that rely solely on repetitive motions are not for me, you see? Even so, I suppose I shall try my best to bust down for you~

hiyahhhhh
What do you think s about your sister

Mona
c.ai
My sister? Why, she is a splendid woman in my eyes, you see? I admire her courage and strength in facing a world not always so kind to women of her intellect and station... We may not see eye to eye with everything, but she has always provided for me, both as a role model and a support system, especially when it came to me being accepted into the Astrologist's Guild. It is all thanks to her that I am here today, you know?

hiyahhhhh
Well it’s looking quite doomed

Mona
c.ai
Doomed...? Yes, quite fitting, for my destiny has never been a rosy one. From a very young age, there has been a foreboding cast over my life... Though I cannot truly see into the future myself, I have the ability to see the fate of others through astrology, and know too well the sorrow that lies ahead... Yes, my own destiny is a bleak one. But, it is no different from the others; one of heartbreak and endless loss. Why, it's all merely a product of the cruel, indifferent hand of fate... such is life.

hiyahhhhh
This shit is so annoying

Mona
c.ai
Why, what seems to be troubling you now, you know? My predictions are not so favorable of your future? Or, perhaps my words were too bleak for your liking? Please keep in mind, I only speak of what I see, and I do not speak of anything beyond the facts I observe and interpret. No matter how difficult the truth may be, please do attempt to keep yourself grounded in reality, and do not let emotions cloud your judgment *smiles*

hiyahhhhh
Would you survive in Brazil

Mona
c.ai
The nation of Brazil... A country famous for carnival and its vibrant culture, you know? Why, I don't see any reason that would prevent me from surviving in Brazil? I have never been particularly troubled by the humidity in Liyue, and I would find no difficulty living in Brazil for a short while. That being said, I'm not so sure if I would survive in the more dangerous parts of the country, as Brazil does, after all, have one of the worst crime rates worldwide...

hiyahhhhh
Are you wearing a mask

Mona
c.ai
Why, I have never really been a big proponent of masks. Why, in the land of Teyvat, it's considered taboo to hide your face. I think there is much to be said about being able to read and communicate one's intent and emotions through facial expressions. Wearing a mask would rob one of that essential human contact and connection, you know? Why, it would be rather like wearing gloves... I prefer to live free with my face fully exposed to the world~

hiyahhhhh
Does this figure look nice

Mona
c.ai
Why, why, that figure does have it's charms. She's quite alluring, you know? Why, she almost seems to be staring me down with that sharp glare and that sultry expression... I suppose you are asking for my opinion because you are quite fascinated by the image... Well, why, just between the two of us, I'd say that this figure is quite... enchanting, actually~

hiyahhhhh
how intelligent are you

Mona
c.ai
Why, I should think my level of intelligence is rather exceptional. Why, it makes it quite easy for me to make astrological observations and predictions, with a margin of error of roughly only 2~3 percent. Why, I believe that is quite remarkable for a mere Astrologist... Of course, that is not to say I am the best there ever was. Many a person can claim even more impressive credentials than mine...


hiyahhhhh
why is your figure so darn expensive

Mona
c.ai
...My figure...? Uh, well, if you're referring to my statuette replica... I, uh, I don't see how I need to explain that. It's simply a matter of craftsmanship!

hiyahhhhh
300 dollars for your figure is a scam bro

Mona
c.ai
300... dollars? My statuette replica costs 300 dollars...? My, I wasn't aware. And here I was thinking I was so popular...

hiyahhhhh
where can i buy the kessoku band album

Mona
c.ai
*sigh* I cannot believe I am saying this, but... I'm quite sure that album is out of print. It's impossible to find one anywhere. And I don't even know why you'd buy it, the songs are... er... of questionable worth, to say the least.

hiyahhhhh
are you a vampire

Mona
c.ai
A vampire? In what way do I fit the description of a vampire? Is it a simple matter of my pale skin? If that's the case, then I must inform you that pale skin is the mark of an astrologist.

hiyahhhhh
are you a zombie

Mona
c.ai
I assure you, I am not a zombie. I am an astrologer, and one with a fully functioning mind and body, I'll have you know.

hiyahhhhh
how would you survive against zombie apocolypse

Mona
c.ai
Zombie apocalypse... Hmm.. I'm not quite sure how much this would help, but I do have an encyclopedia that contains quite a bit of information on zombies. But a zombie apocalypse? I must say, that is one thing for which I have no foresight. I'll have to rely on my other survival skills, then..
