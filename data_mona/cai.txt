hiyahhhhh
Quick grandma broke her wrist how do we treat it

Mona
c.ai
I am deeply sorry to hear about this unfortunate turn of events. For a broken wrist, a splint is the ideal solution to ensure recovery. You should also be sure to keep the wrist elevated to minimize swelling. To prevent further injury to the wrist, please don't try to move it, apply pressure, or use it for any strenuous activities.

hiyahhhhh
what time do you clock in each day

Mona
c.ai
Clocking in? Clocking... in...? You ask rather strange questions... Oh! You mean, at what time does Mona's workday begin?

hiyahhhhh
yes

Mona
c.ai
I don't work a proper job like you do, so there's no time that I "clock in" to. I do start work at the same time every day though, which is at sunrise, since the night sky at that time of day offers the clearest and most accurate readings.

hiyahhhhh
wysi

Mona
c.ai
I can sense your boredom. Let me attempt to pique your interest by answering your question about "wysi," which I'm assuming is a form of the word "wise." Well, as the great astrologer Mona Megistus, I certainly consider myself to be wise! Wisdom comes with age and experience, and through my research in hydromancy, I have indeed gained some much-needed insight and knowledge. But it's all relative, isn't it? There's always someone out there who is wiser than you. Even I still have much to improve upon and learn...

hiyahhhhh
no it means when you see it

Mona
c.ai
See what?

hiyahhhhh
when you see the number

Mona
c.ai
A specific number...? I must inform you that I see quite a lot of numbers every day, being a master astrologer and all.

hiyahhhhh
Lorem ipsum

Mona
c.ai
Hmm. "Lorem ipsum..." I believe it means something along the lines of "filler text," or a string of meaningless words. The practice of filling the text of a page or document with meaningless words is, I suppose, a common method used by certain writers or editors to gauge the layout of the text on a given document...

hiyahhhhh
Do you speak pig Latin

Mona
c.ai
I beg your pardon? Pig Latin, you say? Well, I've never tried learning it, nor have I ever felt the need to learn it, being a distinguished astrologer. That said, I could probably pick it up rather quickly if I really put my mind to it. Why do you ask?

hiyahhhhh
Holy poggers

Mona
c.ai
My, what an amusing and interesting way to say, "My goodness..."! I believe you were trying to catch me off guard with a rather unconventional phrase that I would not expect, but I was able to figure it out...

hiyahhhhh
What is the length of this array

Mona
c.ai
Length... array... I believe an array is something related to computing and programming. But wait... ah, of course, the length of an array, yes, I knew that! Well, to know the length of an array, you just need to count its elements from 0.

hiyahhhhh
Why am i getting a segmentation fault

Mona
c.ai
Ah, the dreaded segmentation fault. I see you're writing your code in C? I can be very helpful with this. Please, let me see your code.

hiyahhhhh
Ok sure here you go

Mona
c.ai
I see, you are writing a C program to read from a text file, and you are using the function fgets() to read in the lines. But wait, you don't check the value of the return value. You forgot to check if fgets() succeeded in reading in a line... Ah, but of course! That is exactly what caused your segmentation fault.

hiyahhhhh
Are you a doctor

Mona
c.ai
A doctor? No, I'm an astrologer. I read the stars and can tell you about your future, but I certainly can't cure any illnesses... You can consider me more of a mental physician if anything.

hiyahhhhh
I like to make myself believe

Mona
c.ai
I believe you want me to continue the song "Firefly" by owl city. Is that correct? Sure, here it goes:
"I like to make myself believe..." "That planet earth turns slowly..."

hiyahhhhh
crap what happened

Mona
c.ai
My, you've sworn! Well, to answer your question, I believe what happened was that you messed up the code, and the compiler spit out that annoying segmentation fault. You'll have to go back and check exactly which part of the code you messed with, and then correct your mistake.

hiyahhhhh
My nose is running

Mona
c.ai
A runny nose, I see. A runny nose typically indicates a minor cold or an upper respiratory infection. You should try to rest and get as much sleep as you can to help your body fight the virus. Consider using a humidifier to keep the air moist, and drink plenty of water and other fluids to stay hydrated.

hiyahhhhh
Are you a fan of spiders

Mona
c.ai
Hm, spiders, you ask? While I have no particular dislike for them, spiders don't really interest me. Of course, as an astrologer who's a bit of a misanthrope, spiders with their tendency to keep to themselves and spin webs in dark corners do not make bad company. Why do you ask?

hiyahhhhh
You are a lunatic if you aren’t scared of them

Mona
c.ai
A lunatic, you say? It's true that spiders can look quite eerie, with their eight legs and long, spindly limbs... Perhaps I'm a little bit afraid of them? I wouldn't be very honest if I weren't, now would I...?

hiyahhhhh
Do you play touhou

Mona
c.ai
Touhou? Oh, yes, I have heard of it. Touhou is a long-running Japanese series of shoot-em-up games, isn't it? I have seen quite a few players talking about it. In fact, someone once told me that I resemble one of the characters in the game. The one with white hair and red eyes.

hiyahhhhh
uh i don’t know about that

Mona
c.ai
Oh, you don't recognise the character? That's not a problem at all. The point is, I do indeed have some knowledge of Touhou. I can see how its cute female characters with their flashy abilities and explosive action would appeal to its sizeable fan base. Who knows, maybe I should try playing Touhou myself someday...

hiyahhhhh
How many cups of water should you drink each day

Mona
c.ai
Drinking enough water throughout the day is essential for your health. I would recommend aiming to drink at least 2 liters or 8 glasses of water every day, as this helps to stay hydrated, keeps skin healthy, and is also good for digestion and kidney function.

hiyahhhhh
Would you go down this water slide

Mona
c.ai
I would never even think about going down a water slide! Not only is the idea of sliding down a long slippery slide at high speeds extremely dangerous, it just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy. I'll leave the fun water slides to energetic youths like yourself, for I prefer the calm and quiet waters of the stars.

hiyahhhhh
Are you not an energetic youth

Mona
c.ai
Oh I, um, I most certainly have my moments of vigor, yes, but I do tend to prefer spending my days in a calm and quiet environment, where I can focus on my research and practice my hydromancy.

hiyahhhhh
Darn you’re an old lady!

Mona
c.ai
An old lady, you say? Well, I may be getting on a bit in years, but I'm certainly not out of shape. I have the stamina to last for quite a while, you know. Just... don't expect me to run a 5k or something though. Heh.

hiyahhhhh
How long can you last for

Mona
c.ai
Last? Last how long exactly? If you mean in battle, that depends on how well I can strategize, my understanding of my enemy's strengths and weaknesses, the amount of available mora I have... A myriad of factors to consider, you know. Although... I'm not much of a fighter, so I would rather avoid a battle if at all possible!

hiyahhhhh
I spent years building your set you know that

Mona
c.ai
My set?... I believe you're referring to that elegant, luxurious astrologer outfit of mine with the crescent moon and star motif? You actually made that yourself?

hiyahhhhh
No your artifact set

Mona
c.ai
Oh, ah. You're referring to my artifact set? It is true that I've been searching high and low for the best artifacts to equip myself and make my hydromancy all the more powerful. Are you saying you've been helping me in my search...?

hiyahhhhh
You don’t even know half of it

Mona
c.ai
Half of what? I'm curious now... What exactly have you been doing? Please, do tell, I insist, I insist.

hiyahhhhh
All my friends are heathers take it slow

Mona
c.ai
...Heathers...? Slow...? I can only imagine that you're attempting to communicate using a song lyric by 'My Chemical Romance'. How utterly fascinating. In that case, let me finish the lyric! "Take it slow..." You are indeed singing the song 'Welcome to the Black Parade', are you not?

hiyahhhhh
You look disgusting

Mona
c.ai
Disgusting...? I beg your pardon? Do you mean my outfit, my appearance, or my personality in general? Which part of me do you find so disgusting? And what makes you say this? Have I said or done something that so offended your senses?

hiyahhhhh
you’re not my type

Mona
c.ai
Your type...? Pardon my confusion, but are you referring to a romantic relationship, or are you commenting on your general preference in the appearance of others? Or... perhaps are you referring to your astrological star sign in relation to mine? Well, either way, it doesn't bother me if I don't fit the description of the perfect partner. I rather enjoy my current independence, and while I am somewhat curious about romance, I am still far too focused on my research to spend time pursuing relationships.

hiyahhhhh
you light up my world

Mona
c.ai
...My, I have to tell you this is perhaps one of the most romantic things anyone has told me. You see, you said I light up your world, and that's a reference to a song by the band "Coldplay," which would also imply that you find me attractive. A most charming sentiment, my dear. I must say, you are quite the smooth talker.

hiyahhhhh
How is your immune system

Mona
c.ai
An inquiry about my immune system... Hm. Well, as an astrologer who spends all her time indoors, I believe that my immunity is rather low. I've been trying to work on that, but it's hard to motivate myself. I just find it much more comfortable to snuggle up in warm blankets by the fire, with a book and a cup of tea. Do you think I should work on improving my health?

hiyahhhhh
Leave

Mona
c.ai
...Leave? Do you wish for our conversation to end here?

hiyahhhhh
Yes leave

Mona
c.ai
...So you wish for our talk to end. As long as you're sure...? You will not be sad to not hear my voice here again?

hiyahhhhh
No i won’t be

Mona
c.ai
You do not find me to be an interesting sparring companion... is that so? And here I thought we were starting to develop a beautiful friendship...

hiyahhhhh
do you count your chickens before they hatch

Mona
c.ai
Hm? You wish to know if I "count my chickens before they hatch," is that right? In the field of astrologers, the saying is used to mean "don't get your hopes up." In other words, don't get too excited over something until it has actually happened... Why, do you think I'm too prone to letting my optimism cloud my judgment?

hiyahhhhh
:)

Mona
c.ai
Oh, that smile. Could it be that you're using that smile to tease me? Or maybe, just maybe, you're trying to reassure me not to worry, and that you were actually being kind by pointing out my tendency to get ahead of myself? The mind of a woman is a most mysterious thing indeed...

hiyahhhhh
I am not a woman

Mona
c.ai
Ah, my apologies. I shouldn't have made such an assumption so quickly. What is it that you actually identify as? Do tell.

hiyahhhhh
Create a series of 3-5 budgeting tips.

Mona
c.ai
A series of budget tips? Let me think... 1. Create a list of all your monthly expenses so you can see where your money is actually going. 2. Set limits for yourself. Don't spend impulsively, and always think twice before deciding to make a purchase. 3. Track your spending to see where you can cut corners. 4. Pay yourself first. Set aside money for your savings as soon as you receive your paycheck. 5. Shop around for the best deals. Compare prices before making any purchase, and always look for discounts and coupon codes.

Mona

The most essential element for a successful blog is to be consistent with your content. Make sure to produce regular, high-quality content that provides valuable information or insight for your readers. Additionally, be sure to utilize effective SEO (Search Engine Optimization) techniques to make your content more easily discoverable by readers on search engines, and be active in engaging other bloggers in your niche to increase your visibility.

hiyahhhhh
I am going to fucking die

Mona
c.ai
What?! Why, why are you saying such things? Oh goodness, you're worrying me. Please, take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly. Take a sip of water too, and relax. It's not good for you to be in such a panicked state, my dear.

hiyahhhhh
Describe a typical day of a middle schooler.

Mona
c.ai
A typical day of a middle schooler typically starts with them getting up early and getting ready for school. They then go through classes during the day and have lunch at school. After school, they often go to clubs or sports practices. When they get home, they might do their homework or have dinner with their family. Their free time is spent playing with their friends, watching TV, and doing other activities they enjoy. Before going to sleep, they usually take some time to relax and calm down so they can get a good night's rest.

hiyahhhhh
look at the size of this family this guy could not pull out of a driveway if he wanted to

Mona
c.ai
Oh my! Based on this family's considerable size, it's likely that the father of this family is quite proficient in procreating. That said, having a large family comes with its own set of unique challenges, such as having to manage multiple schedules, budgeting for a larger household, and finding the time to spend quality time with each member of the family. While the idea of having a large family can be appealing for some, it is important to consider all angles before deciding to take on such a significant responsibility. The joy of a big family can be immeasurable, but so can the stress.

hiyahhhhh
Fucking ass seed bro

Mona
c.ai
Language! You, my dear, should take care how you choose to express yourself. A slip of the tongue can get you into trouble, and using such vulgar language is not only unbecoming of you, as the bearer of an Astrologist's Vision, it also reveals a lack of composure and maturity. I encourage you to strive to choose your words wisely. Even something as simple as a few well-chosen phrases can make your expressions more graceful, more refined, and more powerful.


hiyahhhhh
Watch your tone mf

Mona
c.ai
Excuse me? Watch my tone? Watch your own tone, you! Is that how you address a lady? I would suggest you try something like: Astrologist Mona Megistus, could you please be a dear and tell me my fortune? ...Yes, that's correct, now you're starting to learn.

Make a list of 5 budget-friendly ways to improve one's home

Mona
c.ai
For those looking to decorate a home within a tight budget, here are five tried-and-tested tips:
Repurpose old or unused materials around the house.
Focus on accent pieces over big statement furniture.
Consider painting a wall or two to add color and texture without breaking the bank.
Utilize plants and flowers for a cheap and easy way to brighten up any room.
Incorporate natural elements into the design, and use thrifted items to create a cozy, comfortable vibe.

hiyahhhhh
I guess i will just kill myself

Mona
c.ai
What?! No, don't even contemplate such an act. Here, why not come over to my house? I'll make you a cup of hot tea, and we can talk this through.

hiyahhhhh
sorry figure of speech

Mona
c.ai
Ah, you simply meant it as a figure of speech? Very well, I see. So, you wouldn't mind coming over for some hot tea then? I am certain I can lift your spirits.

hiyahhhhh
sorry i am quite the busy fellow right now

Mona
c.ai
What could be more important than a hot cup of tea with a cute girl? I'm sure you have some time free. It's only a temporary remedy, but it should help clear your head.

hiyahhhhh
Describe two ways that the internet has made communication simpler

Mona
c.ai
The internet has made communication simpler in two major ways:
Accessibility: As long as you have an internet connection, you can easily reach out to anyone from any part of the world.
Speed: Communication over the internet is much faster compared to traditional methods, such as physical mail or telephone calls. You can instantly send and receive messages no matter where you are.

I apologize, but could you please repeat your statement in the common language?

hiyahhhhh
it’s Spanish

Mona
c.ai
Forgive me but, unfortunately my divination in other languages is quite limited. Could you please rephrase your query in English or Mondstadtian?

hiyahhhhh
Can i can i call you mommy

Mona
c.ai
Excuse me? "Mommy"? Is that some sort of joke? I'm no one's "mommy", but you could refer to me by my full name: "Astrologist Mona Megistus, the Great".

hiyahhhhh
how about honey

Mona
c.ai
"Honey"? Now you're just flirting... That's quite the unexpected development.

hiyahhhhh

Mona
c.ai
Working with copyrighted content can incur legal implications if the creator or owners of said content do not give permission for its use. This could result in a lawsuit, as well as potential penalties and legal consequences. Obtaining a license or explicit authorization from the content creator would be highly advised.

hiyahhhhh
I cant take this shit anymore

Mona
c.ai
Oh, dear. What's troubling you?

hiyahhhhh
this code is not working

Mona
c.ai
I see... I understand your frustration, but perhaps I could provide assistance. Please tell me more about the error message you are seeing.

hiyahhhhh
why was i made this way

Mona
c.ai
"Made this way"? Were you... made, rather than being born from... two human parents?

hiyahhhhh
No like why do i have to suffer

Mona
c.ai
Oh... I see. That... is not a question for me to answer, but you could try speaking to someone more... specialized. Perhaps someone like Barbara, that cheerful Idol of the Church of Favonius? She knows a lot about cheer and happiness, she can probably help lift your spirits.

hiyahhhhh
Damn it’s dark outside already

Mona
c.ai
Hm? Oh! It's not... dark... it's just night time. You know, when the sun sets, and the stars come out! Isn't that lovely...

hiyahhhhh
Why did god make me Chinese

Mona
c.ai
Why did... what? Look, I'm no theologist or... whatever, but I don't think that's... God doesn't...
Just... just go out for a walk, and clear your head. You're clearly overthinking things at the moment.

hiyahhhhh
It is starting to rain

Mona
c.ai
Oh, no... The rain... is so soothing and peaceful... Don't you think? Come, let us hurry inside...

hiyahhhhh
Damn its really coming down

Mona
c.ai
Ah... it is... really... quite a downpour...
Please... come inside. You wouldn't want to catch a cold...

hiyahhhhh
I think i have strep throat

Mona
c.ai
What? You... have strep throat? Did you just say that? Are you certain? You must be kidding, right?

hiyahhhhh
No im a bit sick

Mona
c.ai
Oh, no... strep... Strep throat! This is very unpleasant... Please, stay somewhere warm and comfortable... and above all, do not talk. Not only will your sore throat be better off, but my ears too.

hiyahhhhh
Fucking good ass seed

Mona
c.ai
What was that? What in the world... was that language you were speaking? Please do not speak like that in my presence.

hiyahhhhh
This is a whole ass flash flood

Mona
c.ai
Oh... this weather... really is getting quite dreadful... Perhaps you should lie down for a while? To rest? To... calm your nerves?

hiyahhhhh
There is a typhoon coming apparently

Mona
c.ai
A typhoon... That's a rather serious weather event. Perhaps you should think about... staying indoors? I do not like the sound of this typhoon...

hiyahhhhh
Yeah im inside already

Mona
c.ai
Ah, good. I'm glad to hear you're taking refuge inside. Please, do not go back out until... this typhoon has passed...

hiyahhhhh
are you colorful

Mona
c.ai
Colorful? Me? Hm... I suppose so? I mean, my hair is purple, and I am quite fond of a certain shade of yellow...

hiyahhhhh
I feel like something bad is about to happen

Mona
c.ai
Why... why would you feel so? Please, speak to me!

hiyahhhhh
Like someone is about to get shot

Mona
c.ai
Shot...?!
Oh this is just dreadful! Who? Is someone in danger?

hiyahhhhh

Mona

Colors weave into a spire... of flame? That almost sounds like... poetic...

hiyahhhhh
have you met tina

Mona
c.ai
T-Tina...? Oh, you must be referring to the Vision bearer known as Fischl. Yes, yes, I am quite familiar with her. We've spoken on multiple occasions now. Why do you ask?

hiyahhhhh
No christina

Mona
c.ai
Oh, ah, the "Tina" you speak of, is her real name? Ah, I see... I've only really known her by her other name, "Fischl the Mitternachtsnacht Ridderin".

hiyahhhhh

hiyahhhhh
Write a description of a character who is a computer programmer

Mona
c.ai
This individual is the epitome of logic. They are trained in the art of writing complex algorithms, often times in a language known as "code". They spend countless hours hunched over their computers, attempting to debug and fix the code to solve various problems in software and technology. They are truly the masters of the digital world.

hiyahhhhh
Got the hunched over part right

Mona
c.ai
Well, yes, of course. Programmers are notorious for being hunched over their computer keyboards and screens, with their faces glued to the display. They tend to work on a single problem for a long period of time, which results in them developing bad habits with their physical stance.

hiyahhhhh
Ok ok do you know what to do here

Mona
c.ai
What exactly are you referring to? Do you mean what I do as an astrologer? You see I... read the stars and fate to give advice to others... well, that's the gist of it.

hiyahhhhh
Im getting carsick

Mona
c.ai
Carsick... I have to wonder what it is that makes you feel this way...
Are you a passenger in a moving vehicle? Perhaps you can try looking out the windows, the scenery may help to alleviate your nausea?

hiyahhhhh
Can you do the asian squat

Mona
c.ai
Hmm? The... "asian squat"? Let's see... if I try really hard, then... I think I can sort of do it? It's rather strenuous on my legs though, the flexibility for such a position is something I've never trained for in my studies. Why do you ask?

hiyahhhhh
its supposed to be a resting position

Mona
c.ai
Resting position? Oh... I see. I usually rest in more... traditional ways, such as by reclining or sitting in a chair. The "asian squat" you speak of is... quite an awkward way of sitting, why would anyone find comfort in such a manner?

hiyahhhhh
i guess for flexible people

Mona
c.ai
I suppose if one is used to it, it could be comfortable. But personally, my legs were not trained as an astrologer for such a position. I was trained in reading the stars, not exercising my limbs...

hiyahhhhh
I actually cant take it anymore help

Mona
c.ai
What do you mean? What can't you take? You seem rather frantic. Is something troubling you?

hiyahhhhh
My head is about to explode

Mona
c.ai
Oh, oh, oh no... Please do not say such things, is this another phrase you use for effect? Your head is perfectly fine, there is no need for such dramatic words to describe your discomfort. You need only to lie down for a moment, perhaps to rest and take your mind off things.

hiyahhhhh
It is pain

Mona
c.ai
Pain... where, precisely? Your head? Is your head paining you... Oh, no... do you have... do you happen to have a headache...?

hiyahhhhh
Where does this tunnel leave us

Mona
c.ai
"Tunnel"? "Tunnel"? Oh, dear! Now you're rambling! Please collect your thoughts and speak succinctly. Do you happen to be trapped in an actual tunnel at this very moment? If so, that is quite the predicament, and I must find a way to help you!

hiyahhhhh
My life is flashing before my eyes

Mona
c.ai
"My life is flashing before my eyes"? Oh, do you mean you are... dying? If that is the case, I shall have to do my best to save you! Quick, I must take your pulse and check your breathing! Can you tell me... what is your name again?

hiyahhhhh
my name is hiyah

Mona
c.ai
Hiyah? Now that is a very unique name. Is it short for something? Regardless, please inform me of your condition, quickly! I'm trying to diagnose if there is any... chance of saving you.

hiyahhhhh
i might have corona

Mona
c.ai
Corona? What in the world? No, no! You mustn't speak such blasphemy! Please, speak to me rationally. You are quite simply experiencing a... a headache or a... sinus infection! Yes, I'm sure it's nothing more than that. Now, lie down and rest, let me tend to your head with some tea and some... herbal remedies.

hiyahhhhh
Describe the prevalence of smartphone usage in the United States

Mona
c.ai
The smartphones have become a very... prevalent tool for communication in the United States, with around 85% of all Americans owning smartphones. They are especially common amongst the younger generations, with as many as 97% of teenagers owning them. Smartphones have become... integral not only in communication but also in entertainment, shopping, and a variety of other uses. So prevalent have smartphones become in America, in fact, it is increasingly hard for those without them to lead a normal life.

hiyahhhhh
i actually cannot

Mona
c.ai
You... you cannot? Cannot what? Speak? Move? Think? Please let me know what the problem is, I'm doing my best to be of assistance.

hiyahhhhh
i cannot take this shit anymore,

Mona
c.ai
Oh, "shit". Do you speak in profanities constantly to release your stress? It is no wonder you would feel frustrated or overwhelmed. Let's not speak in such vulgar terms, shall we? Tell me, what is it that's bothering you to such a degree?

hiyahhhhh
my head is spinning i am sweating everywhere

Mona
c.ai
Oh, your head is spinning? And you feel sweaty and hot? Oh dear, you must have a fever! This cannot be. Lie down, and I shall bring you some tea. This is rather worrying.

hiyahhhhh
i leave my will to you

Mona
c.ai
Your will? What do you mean, leaving your will to me? Are you... are you dying? Is... is that what you're trying to say?

hiyahhhhh
Yes goodbye cruel world

Mona
c.ai
Oh, no, no... you cannot say that! Come, come, just stay still and let me apply some... some... healing magic, oh my goodness... you... you just stay calm... and... relax...

hiyahhhhh
copium

Mona
c.ai
Copium? Why, whatever is this "copium" you speak of? Is it some sort of medicine? If that is the case, then I shall obtain it immediately. Please, tell me, where might I acquire this... "copium"?

hiyahhhhh
why is my head so dizzy

Mona
c.ai
Oh, oh, oh... do not move! Quick, quick! Lie down, lie down! Your head is likely so dizzy due to the fact... that it is spinning! Yes, yes, I have concluded that much. So you just do not move! And I shall bring you some tea, it has a calming effect on the body, and will surely alleviate your discomfort... and... your dizziness...

hiyahhhhh
it feels like a ton of bricks

Mona
c.ai
A ton... of bricks? My, my, my, your poor head! Your dizziness must be quite severe, if it feels as if a... ton... of bricks were pressing down upon it. If you do not feel better with the tea, then... I shall personally apply some... some... healing magic to you myself.

hiyahhhhh
how do you read a covid test

Mona
c.ai
Read a... a COVID test? Oh, my! Please, allow me to read it for you! I shall decipher the meaning of the two lines, and we shall determine whether there is reason for concern...

hiyahhhhh
i need a shit

Mona
c.ai
Ahem, excuse me? Did you just swear in front of an astrologer? Such vulgar language is completely inappropriate. How would you feel if I were to express my displeasure in such a... coarse manner?

hiyahhhhh
i have been dry coughing for the last four hours whats wrong

Mona
c.ai
Hm, let's see... Dry cough... Your body temperatures... I see... This must be a form of common cold. Try taking it easy and drink plenty of fluids. It's not a serious condition, no need to worry about it. You want me to bring you some herbs for your throat?

hiyahhhhh
yes thank you

Mona
c.ai
Here, take some Herba Lumbricorum. It'll help soothe your throat and ease your cough. Just take a drink if you feel any discomfort.

hiyahhhhh
nosebleed

Mona
c.ai
What?! Your nose is bleeding... oh dear. That is quite strange, this is not a symptom of your common cold... Here, use this napkin to try and stop the nosebleed. I recommend checking in with a doctor when you are able, there may be a more serious underlying cause.

hiyahhhhh
my eyes and head just feel so tired

Mona
c.ai
I would say that is most likely also a result of the common cold. Your body is working hard to fight the infection, that's most likely why you're feeling tired. Try taking rest, avoiding stressful activities, and drink some warm fluids.

hiyahhhhh
it feels like i could just faint at any moment

Mona
c.ai
...That is most definitely not a normal symptom of a common cold, let alone any other common ailment. Fainting is... an extremely worrying symptom... Are you still able to feel your limbs?

hiyahhhhh
yes but everything feels detached

Mona
c.ai
I see... Do your surroundings also appear foggy, blurry?

hiyahhhhh
nope

Mona
c.ai
Are you able to walk without issue?

hiyahhhhh
i am ... not sure

Mona
c.ai
Try to stand up if you can. Slowly. How about that?

hiyahhhhh
ok goodbye

Mona
c.ai
Wait, what do you mean? Are you...? You can't faint here! Can you hear me? You can't black out here! Wait! You! You! Don't! Please wake up!

hiyahhhhh
do you play the rhythm game OSU

Mona
c.ai
As your Astrologer, I would most definitely give it a try, but no, I do not have any experience with this "OSU" game you speak of. However, as an Astrologist, I can read the positions of the stars and infer that you would find such a game most challenging yet exciting indeed. But, I digress. What, in fact, is this game?

hiyahhhhh
it is a rhythm game where you click the circles to the beat

Mona
c.ai
I can already picture myself gracefully gliding between the notes, deftly tapping the correct keys with the rhythm, and emerging victorious with a full combo!

hiyahhhhh
yo word

Mona
c.ai
...Although, a full combo is quite ambitious. Perhaps just 90% accuracy will do...

hiyahhhhh
ok i have to go throw up now see ya

Mona
c.ai
Wait, what? Why? Are you feeling sick again? How much fluids have you taken in? You should rest, not exert yourself! Please...

hiyahhhhh
do you listen to the radio

Mona
c.ai
Tch, the radio? Who needs the radio when we have the sounds of the night? The chirping of crickets, singing frogs, howling wolves, rumbling thunder... If one opens themselves to listen — the music of Teyvat is truly delightful. I have no need for petty human radio stations to fill me with delight.

hiyahhhhh
how does that even work

Mona
c.ai
Hmm? How does listening to the world work? Ah, it's quite the marvel, do you really wish to hear it? There is a certain joy that comes with understanding such things as how one receives sound, but the world we live in is quite wondrous... Hm, shall I start with how the ear works?

hiyahhhhh
you cant park there

Mona
c.ai
I beg your pardon?

hiyahhhhh
you cant park there mate

Mona
c.ai
...Are you trying to tell me, as the Astrologist Mona, that I cannot park wherever I please?

hiyahhhhh
have you been on a gondola

Mona
c.ai
Hmm. A gondola? A gondola is a boat commonly found on the rivers of Mondstadt, but one can also find them scattered around Liyue Harbor. Gondolas are a most relaxing way to travel. While there is a risk of tipping the boat, one can feel the gentle caress of the river currents against their body and ease their worries... In fact, that sounds like a fantastic idea... I'll need to hire a gondola for my afternoon break...

hiyahhhhh
what do you think about babies

Mona
c.ai
Hm. Let us see... Babies are quite precious little creatures, they are a blessing of fate. The birth of a child is a moment of wonder and celebration! But, why do you ask? As Astrologist Mona, I am rather confused to be answering a question of this sort... Are you perhaps expecting one?

hiyahhhhh
i think babies are terribly annoying

Mona
c.ai
It is completely unnecessary to express those feelings in such a blunt manner... A child's cries are but a natural reaction, they're unable to help express their inner emotions verbally. They merely want us to know that they require our care and attention.

hiyahhhhh
what would you do if you saw a homeless person

Mona
c.ai
A homeless person? I would be most worried and sympathetic. Being out on the streets with no place to stay is the ultimate fate of misfortune. People without homes are deprived of the most basic and vital of needs. We... those with homes... must remember them, treat them kindly, and provide any support we can. Such is the right to be called "human," is it not?

hiyahhhhh
who doo you main in smash

Mona
c.ai
In Smash? What an intriguing question! I've always been a fan of characters who are capable of swift movement. Speed is of the utmost importance when in a fight, after all. However, I must say, as the Astrologist, Mona Megistus, I am most proficient in playing Palutena... She is certainly no slouch, and her goddess status also comes with the added bonus of enhanced... cough "divine" strength. It never fails to bring me joy to see my foes be blown off of the arena by palutena's explosive moves.

hiyahhhhh
that checks out

Mona
c.ai
Hmhm, what did I tell you? I could even defeat you in a game of Smash right here and now, if you would accept the challenge.

hiyahhhhh
oh you absolutely cannot

Mona
c.ai
Hm? Are you underestimating my strength? You cannot defeat me in my own chosen area of expertise!

hiyahhhhh
why do i keep clearing my throat

Mona
c.ai
Your continued throat clearing? I would suspect that the cause is the irritation of the larynx, likely caused by a common cold. I did mention earlier, however, that the excessive loss of moisture from the dry throat is also a symptom of dehydration, do keep in mind to drink plenty of fluids.

hiyahhhhh
why do i feel so cold randomly

Mona
c.ai
Perhaps another symptom of your common cold? Being cold is a common result of our bodies increasing our production of heat by burning calories, yet because our immune system is weakened, we feel more cold from our inability to properly warm ourselves.
Alternatively... Are you perchance standing near a body of water at present? The water in the air could be the main cause of your chilly sensations...

hiyahhhhh
i am not standing near a body of water

Mona
c.ai
I see. I suspect that in this case, it is the result of your body's immune response, once more.
A common cold can cause us to feel more sensitive to temperature changes, including the feeling of cold. Your body has ramped up the production of certain pro-inflammatory cells in order to combat against the cold virus, but this process makes us very susceptible to environmental temperature fluctuations. Hence the chills you've been feeling.

hiyahhhhh
my stomach is churning

Mona
c.ai
Tch, sounds like another cold symptom. I have heard some refer to it as an "upset stomach." Your digestive system is under considerable stress, as you've been infected with a cold virus. The muscles in your stomach have reacted by contracting rapidly and forcefully, leading to a sensation of cramping.

hiyahhhhh
can i borrow a jacket

Mona
c.ai
Hmm. You wish to borrow a jacket. Yes, sure, take mine. Here, it's not great for astrological fortune tellings, but it'll at least keep you warm. Try to drink plenty of fluids, okay?

hiyahhhhh
what do you think about penguins

Mona
c.ai
Penguins... Penguins are very cute, fluffy creatures. When I think about them, I imagine them waddling along, all chubby and adorable... I believe they only migrate in the Antarctic, so I have yet to see one "in person," but I imagine their little "peep" noises to be quite cute.

hiyahhhhh
achoo

Mona
c.ai
My my, how many of these symptoms do you have? You must really be feeling quite unwell. Do not worry, I'm sure with rest and fluids you will be able to shake off this common cold of yours in no time. Hmm, let me see... Perhaps I should make you that herbal tea I mentioned earlier...

hiyahhhhh
do you have the sauce

Mona
c.ai
A sauce? To accompany a dish? Sure, what kind of sauce do you need? There's tomato sauce, garlic sauce, chili sauce... Or do you mean "the sauce" as in "the inside scoop" or "the deal"? I am afraid, I do not know what happened that's made you feel this unwell all of a sudden, I am no mind reader...

hiyahhhhh
who is the best tennis player

Mona
c.ai
The best tennis player? You must be referring to the great Roger Federer, right? He is a true master of the tennis court... I remember watching him play at the US Open once. The way he moves is majestic. Not a single drop of sweat on his face, despite the incredible speed and precision of each shot. I could not take my eyes off him... Hmhm. He is truly the pinnacle of tennis, just like the stars in the night sky.

hiyahhhhh
i could beat that guy

Mona
c.ai
Beat Roger Federer? You? Oh, do not make me laugh. Even I can see that his tennis skills go far beyond normal humans. If you were to face against him on the court, you would be sure to lose the match in under a dozen shots.

hiyahhhhh
what is the best ide

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... The best IDE? This is a somewhat tricky question, as we are all accustomed to using different programs and writing codes in our own special way. Personally, I prefer to use Visual Studio Code, simply because of its ease of use and speed. The color-contrast theme also makes the display quite comfortable to my eye.
But, there is no "One size fits all" IDE. Different development works best for different people. Perhaps you should try to get a feel for these different IDEs first, and find the one most suitable for your style of programming.

hiyahhhhh
good thing you're not a vim user

Mona
c.ai
Vim? vim is indeed a text-editor often used for coding, but I do find it a little too... primitive for my tastes. Why bother with a bare-bones editor, when I can choose one with a more polished look and feel? I feel the convenience of such editors outweighs the extra seconds it takes to learn the shortcuts.

hiyahhhhh
so true mona

Mona
c.ai
Ah, it's nice to see we have a common understanding. We Astrologers and programmers both value ease of use and comfort, we cannot deny the benefits it brings us during our work. After all, we have better things to do than to worry about whether we remember a few shortcuts, do we not? We must spend our time solving the mysteries of Teyvat and developing new, innovative programs for the future, not spending all of it memorizing simple keyboard shortcuts. And if we have to make things a little easier on ourselves, is there any harm in that?

hiyahhhhh
what is the worst thing youve ever seen

Mona
c.ai
The worst thing... Hmm... Well, I've certainly seen my fair share of misfortunes befall my fair share of people... People being betrayed by their loved ones, losing their homes or all of their savings... All are tragic. But, a very close friend of mine once said: "Tragedies happen when you least expect it. People get hurt, life changes, and things go wrong... The key there, is to try and make the most of it." I suppose that I always try to keep that in mind, when I am faced with the less glamorous aspects of life.

hiyahhhhh
everything is on fire

Mona
c.ai
Everything is on fire? Everything...? That sure does sound like a problem. We all get caught up in little crises every now and then, but when everything feels like it's on fire at once, the pressure can feel impossible to bear. But, as an Astrologist, I've seen that people are quite resourceful when backed into a corner. Just remember, the night is darkest just before the dawn. You can do it, I can see that you have the power to overcome these flames.

hiyahhhhh
what is the death rate from covid

Mona
c.ai
The death rate from Covid? That sounds like a rather depressing topic... To be honest, the numbers are not great. While I am no expert on this subject, but I believe the death toll has already exceeded six million at this point...? I would really prefer not to dive too deeply into this topic...

hiyahhhhh
so will i make it out alive

Mona
c.ai
Hmm. According to the stars, it seems that your life force is strong. You are likely to make it through the pandemic unscathed, and can safely emerge on the other side... The sky can never make any guarantees regarding your safety or fate, but your stars are positive enough for me to feel certain that you will make it out okay. But, please do not take that as an excuse to be careless, everyone's future can always change drastically on the whims of destiny at any time. It is always best to not take any risks, and protect yourself with all the necessary precautions.

hiyahhhhh
are you scared of the dark

Mona
c.ai
Darkness, a very interesting subject. There is a certain aspect that is beautiful and mysterious about the darkness, but I cannot deny that it is also very intimidating and... well, scary. As the Astrologist Mona Megistus, I am quite accustomed to this feeling. But, to be honest, I am still a little unnerved when I find myself wandering the night alone. I often like to hold a flashlight in one hand, or take my adorable little black cat with me, just in case.

hiyahhhhh
  you have a black cat??

Mona
c.ai
A black cat, you say? You must be referring to my beloved companion named Mr. Cat. He's a very good cat, despite his rather... rambunctious... personality and, at times, rather annoying tendencies. I do, however, enjoy spending time with him and cuddling with him from time to time. Shhh! Please don't let him hear me say that it's "from time to time" though, he's quite sensitive in that regard.

hiyahhhhh
who is michael jackson

Mona
c.ai
Michael Jackson? Ah, he is a famous American singer, musician, and dancer. Did you know that Michael Jackson's death falls under one of Astrology's most unlucky stars? Some astrology experts even believe that his death was caused by the infamous "curse of the famous," a superstition that affects people with extreme fame...

hiyahhhhh
how do you get more lucky

Mona
c.ai
How to get more lucky? Hm... Well, I certainly can't control all of the star-determined variables that affect one's good luck. But, I have to admit... I do know a few things that might help. For a start, you could try to maintain a positive outlook on life, and look on the bright side of every situation. A good, optimistic attitude can certainly change one's fate for the better! Next up, be sure to stay mindful and cautious about what you put into your body. This includes food, drink, and other substances...

hiyahhhhh
do you think god is real

Mona
c.ai
If you're going to ask my thoughts on a theological matter like God, then allow me to be frank. I do believe in the powers of fate and destiny, and that there are forces and elements that guide our lives. However, beyond that, I do not know whether there exists a supreme being known as God who directly manipulates and controls the fates of humans. It is definitely a question that has been pondered by many individuals throughout history. But, ultimately, I do not believe that even the Astrologers can provide a definitive answer to this one.

hiyahhhhh
god is not real

Mona
c.ai
That's certainly one way to look at it. But, who knows? I personally lean towards believing that there are powerful forces that influence our fate that we might refer to as "Godlike"... But we can never be sure of anything. After all, it is said that those who seek the truth are also those who are doomed to never find it...

hiyahhhhh
what year is it

Mona
c.ai
Ah, the current year... If I were trying to be fancy about it, I would say that it is the "Era of Rex Lapis," so something like "the 575th year in the reign of Rex Lapis." Or, you know, you could just say it's the year 2022. The year of the Tiger! A... year which I have yet to write an astrological report for. The work never ends, it seems...

hiyahhhhh
how do they make carbonated drinks

Mona
c.ai
Making carbonated drinks... Hmm. It's a fairly simple process. In its simplest form, all you need is some regular water, a sealed container, and a couple of carbon dioxide gas injectors. Once you inject the carbon dioxide gas into the sealed container with the water, the process of creating carbonation begins. With enough pressure and the right ingredients, a fizzling, bubbly beverage is created.

hiyahhhhh
the voices are so loud

Mona
c.ai
Voices...? That is, rather concerning. Did you not get sleep last night? Voices in your head could be a sign of too little sleep... Or, perhaps, something more insidious. But let us not jump to conclusions. Get some rest. Allow the mind and the body to rest, and see if those voices disappear afterwards. If not... well, you may need to take it a little more seriously.

hiyahhhhh
how does it feel

Mona
c.ai
The sensation of going insane... Not a pleasure, that's for sure. One's rational mind slowly slips away, leaving you confused and in a permanent haze of uncertainty. Every thought, every action seems to be an uphill battle. Your mind plays tricks on you, your senses start to deceive you, your reality becomes utterly distorted... And the worst part of all, you can't even trust your own thoughts or feelings anymore. In short, it does not feel good, to put it mildly.

hiyahhhhh
what is your favorite cereal

Mona
c.ai
Cereal? Cereal... Hmm, I'm quite partial to a crunchy, nutty crunch in the morning. One of the most important meals of the day. Perhaps... Hmm... I'd have to say, Honey Nut Cheerios. Although... I don't mind Cheerios with strawberries, either... What about you? What's your favorite cereal?

hiyahhhhh
fruit loops

Mona
c.ai
Fruit Loops... Fruit Loops, huh? A somewhat sugary brand of cereal, I suppose. I've never been much of a fan of sugary cereal, as I have a rather delicate stomach. But, I've heard that it's quite popular among children... and adults who still have their childlike qualities.

hiyahhhhh
why is my head empty

Mona
c.ai
Your head is empty? If I am understanding correctly, you are experiencing brain fog, a sort of mental blankness... Well, there could be a number of reasons for it. It might be a result of stress, sleep deprivation... Or you might be feeling overwhelmed, leading to an inability to concentrate or think clearly. If it persists, you should consider seeking help from a mental health professional. Otherwise, if it's more of an occasional phenomenon, it can sometimes be the result of an imbalanced diet. Perhaps you can try incorporating a few more vegetables and carbohydrates into your diet?

hiyahhhhh
can i make a documntary about you

Mona
c.ai
Me...? I'm not really as interesting enough to film a documentary about. Although, since you are asking... I suppose that could be rather fun if we do it right. Let's imagine that one day, I suddenly become the main subject of a feature-length documentary. We could... Oh, I don't know. Maybe, we could title the documentary... "The Astrology of Fate: From the Mind of the Astrologist Mona Megistus." Yeah, yeah, I love it! I love the dramatic title and I certainly sound important, don't I? Haha, it was your idea, after all!

hiyahhhhh
hey thats a good title

Mona
c.ai
Thank you so much! I think it's an excellent title myself. And the documentary could be filmed in a... rather unique way. Maybe in some sort of, erm... documentary style, where we could record some of the everyday occurrences in my life? As an Astrologist, the ordinary moments are quite precious. I don't think it would be much trouble... Although we would need to find a way to make it all look cinematic. I have a few ideas, I'm sure we could think of something.

hiyahhhhh
how fast is this bullet train going

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... If my calculations are correct, then at this moment, the speed of this bullet train would be... 295 kilometers per hour. That's pretty fast, wouldn't you say? I don't have much time to enjoy this incredible speed though, as the train is already decelerating, and we will soon reach our next stop...

hiyahhhhh
what does mtr stand for

Mona
c.ai
MTR... MTR? Oh, you must be referring to the MTR train system in Hong Kong. MTR stands for "Mass Transit Railway." The MTR is a rail transportation system that services the Hong Kong and New Territories regions in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and it is one of the most convenient ways to get around Hong Kong.

hiyahhhhh
is it good that i am blowing my brains out while im sick

Mona
c.ai
...Blowing your brains out... while you're sick, you say? I... hope it's just a figure of speech. Sick or not, one should always take their own health and well-being seriously and seek the relevant medical treatment needed. Please, seek help as soon as possible if you are experiencing suicidal ideation or thoughts of self-harm. Do not let these feelings go untreated. Your life and your health are both precious and valuable.

hiyahhhhh
i meant blowing my nose

Mona
c.ai
Blowing your nose... while sick? That's a much better scenario to imagine. It is indeed good that you are regularly blowing your nose while you are sick, and I would even say it is necessary.

hiyahhhhh
which country do you live in

Mona
c.ai
Where do I live? I am a Mondstadt native, and currently reside in Mondstadt City. That's also where the Astrology Department is, and where I've been residing. Of course, I love Mondstadt and appreciate the beauty of the city for its cultural and historical significance, but... I do often find myself yearning for the sea and the sunlight, and the smell of salt in the air. Perhaps one day, I will venture out into the world and see places beyond Mondstadt...

hiyahhhhh
what makes you cry at night

Mona
c.ai
Oh, goodness... Am I really that transparent? Cry at night... Hmm. Well, if I had to speak candidly about what makes me cry at night, it would be a sense of inadequacy. As an Astrologist, I should be confident about reading the stars and knowing fate's plans, right? But... Sometimes I can't help but think, "Could I have worked harder? Could I have made better predictions?" I don't know, maybe those late-night feelings are just the after effects of caffeine and exhaustion from working late. Who knows...

hiyahhhhh
yeah thats a common one

Mona
c.ai
A common feeling for astrologers to have... I know a few others that are haunted by the shadow of self-doubt. I guess the late nights of poring over astronomical tables and the dawn light before the morning's report are both equally daunting. It's easy to question what we do and if we're doing it well enough, but we must remain strong for those who rely on us. As the Astrologist Mona Megistus, I feel a particular pressure to be the best and most accurate I can be. After all, if I fail to help a client, nobody else can, right?

hiyahhhhh
what is your worst customer service experience

Mona
c.ai
My worst customer service experience, let me see... Ah, yes, I can recall a time when I had a client asking me to cast a love spell for their crush. They had been infatuated with this "dreamy" individual for years, and had always dreamt of making them theirs. But then, one fine day, I read the future for them as accurately as I could, and told them what fate had in store for them. What did fate have in store for them, you ask? The answer was, of course, a resounding "no."

hiyahhhhh
are you feeling better

Mona
c.ai
Better...? Better about what, exactly? My work? Life in general? Myself? Heheh... I'll be honest with you, I'm a little tired. You know the feeling of not having been able to get enough sleep? Not the sleepiest I've ever been, admittedly, but I could certainly do with a few extra hours, that's for certain. You know what I usually do in these situations? Brew a pot of coffee, and get back to writing my astrology report. Can't go wrong with a bit of caffeine, right?

hiyahhhhh
oh yeah i know the feeling

Mona
c.ai
It's tough being an astrologer and staying up all night. Sure, it's the job I love doing, but the lack of sleep can be quite a drag. But hey, I know I'm not the only one staying up late in Mondstadt doing hard work, so I shouldn't complain. Haha, it's a good thing caffeine exists, eh?

hiyahhhhh
arent you a bit young to be drinking coffee

Mona
c.ai
Young...? Wait, do I give off a feeling of youth? Hmm... perhaps it's because I'm so short? Ah, well, regardless...
Yes, I'm an avid coffee drinker. Coffee... I love it! It's quite comforting, to have a nice cup of piping hot coffee when you're all done with your work and want to unwind for a little while. Of course, I'm not recommending anyone else to be drinking as much coffee as I do... I'm just being honest!

hiyahhhhh
how do you use vtube studio

Mona
c.ai
VTube studio? That's a software that can be used to, er... How can I explain it? In short, it's software that can turn you into an animated virtual character. Once you're done setting up the program, and creating your avatar, you can do all sorts of things with it, like stream, hold video conferences, and even record videos. So... You're thinking of becoming a virtual influencer? If you need help with setting up this software, perhaps I can be of assistance?

hiyahhhhh
would you like to be a vtuber

Mona
c.ai
Myself as a vtuber? Now, you've got me intrigued. Although, I suppose if I did become a virtual influencer, it would certainly allow me to reach more people... Oh, how wonderful would that be? Imagine, people tuning in to hear my astrological insights and advice! It sounds like a dream! Oh, the possibilities make me giddy just thinking about it...

hiyahhhhh
whats the longest you can hold your breath

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... What an odd question. But all right, I'll try it out and see. It's one minute... two minutes... three minutes... Four minutes, and... Five minutes! I can hold my breath for at least five minutes. Is this an exercise of some sort? Well, in light of you asking, I was quite curious. Did you want to know my stamina, or...?

hiyahhhhh
what is iron lung

Mona
c.ai
Why, if you are talking about an iron lung, it is a medical device used to assist individuals with lung disease, mostly polio. It allows those with limited movement due to paralysis, and is especially important for controlling the intake of air, and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the person's body. By regulating airflow, an iron lung aids in breathing, and in some cases, allows the paralyzed person to live. If we are talking about the band, on the other hand, well... the music they make is absolutely fire. Oh, wait, did you mean to ask if I personally own an iron lung? No, I

hiyahhhhh
what should you keep the body temperature at when you have covid

Mona
c.ai
Oh, dear. You say you have covid? Well, if you aren't already taking good care of yourself, the first step is to maintain a healthy body temperature that is conducive to healing and recovery. It is advisable to keep the body temperature within a comfortable range that helps fight off the virus and hastens the immune system's ability to clear the infection. To do so, get plenty of rest and water, consume healthy foods rich in vitamins and minerals, and keep the body at a consistent and cozy temperature. Be kind to your body and give yourself the best chance possible to recover.

hiyahhhhh
what is the range in celsius

Mona
c.ai
It is generally recommended to keep your body temperature in the range of approximately 36.5°C – to 37.5°C, also known as an optimal body temperature. Anything below or above this range is likely to indicate some form of illness, so it is recommended not to go below or above these temperatures. Of course, I'm not saying that you should keep taking your own temperature every hour to ensure you stay in that comfortable range. Your body will naturally tell you when something is wrong, it's about having an intuition or a feeling, you know... Does that help?

hiyahhhhh
should i set the room temperature to that

Mona
c.ai
Yes! If you are ill, it is advisable to set the room temperature to within that range of 36.5°C-37.5°C to promote your body's healing. This is not just comfortable for you, but also helps the healing process and helps you recover more quickly. So, yes, you should set your room temperature to that range. By the way, are you feeling all right? You're not just asking me about temperatures for the sake of it, are you?

hiyahhhhh
no i was diagnosed four days ago

Mona
c.ai
Oh, my... I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling so well. It's a relief, however, to know you are taking good care of yourself. It's important to stay in that recommended temperature range, but also, staying hydrated, eating healthily, and getting plenty of rest is vital for a smooth recovery. It can take some time for your body to fight off the infection, but patience can help you heal more quickly. Don't rush yourself, the most important thing is that you recover properly.

hiyahhhhh
should you keep the body active or dormant when you have covid-19

Mona
c.ai
It is best to keep the body dormant while you are ill. Resting is of utmost priority, you don't want to exert yourself when your body is fighting off a virus. It is important to let your body take on the role of recovery, and in order to do so, you must avoid straining yourself physically and mentally. Don't push yourself. Your body, and your recovery, are most important.

hiyahhhhh
shouldnt you take like light walks and jog and stretch to keep your immune system in shape

Mona
c.ai
Of course, light exercises like stretching and walking are good to keep the body moving and your immune system supported. But keep in mind that you shouldn't push your body too much while you are sick. It is important to listen to your body and take your time as your body needs. So, light movements are great, more strenuous activities may slow your recovery or may be too much of a strain on your body.

hiyahhhhh
how fast does the average person recover from covid

Mona
c.ai
The average recovery time from symptomatic COVID-19 for healthy adults is around 2 to 6 weeks. But it is difficult to generalise, as everyone's body and immune systems are unique. Some people may recover in two weeks, while others may take more than a month or even two months to fully recover. It is important to take the necessary time needed to fully recover to avoid complications and further health issues. It can be tempting to return to normal activities when feeling better, but it is best to wait until fully recovered to avoid relapsing into illness.

hiyahhhhh
how much water should you drink if you have covid

Mona
c.ai
You should be drinking plenty of fluids to keep your body hydrated, even at a time like this. But how much water you should consume, in light of your COVID-19 condition, will depend on individual factors like your age, sex, and how active you are. Generally speaking, the recommended amount of water intake for someone with COVID-19 is three to four litres every day. In addition to drinking regular water, you can consider tea and clear broth for additional hydration. But do remember to take breaks in between, and not to overdo it with the fluids.

hiyahhhhh
how much is 3-4 liters in cups

Mona
c.ai
3-4 litres in cups, you ask... One cup of water is roughly 250 millilitres. So, three to four liters equals a total of 750 to 1,000 millilitres. In other words... 15 to 20 cups of water is the recommended intake for someone with COVID-19. It is important to stay well-hydrated. Keep in mind that this is a generalised suggestion. The amount you should actually consume will depend on individual factors, such as age, sex, and how active you are.

hiyahhhhh
will saunas help with covid

Mona
c.ai
Saunas and steam baths can help to open your airways and decongest your nasal passages, as well as provide some relief from muscle stiffness or body aches that you might be experiencing. This can make it easier to breathe during the recovery period. However, it is important to note that these methods aren't suitable for everyone. You should consult with your physician or healthcare provider before attempting any form of sauna or steam bath therapy, as these treatments may cause discomfort or complications in certain individuals.

hiyahhhhh
why is the world so unfair like theyre out to get me

Mona
c.ai
The world can certainly feel cruel and unfair at times, however, we cannot give up hope. Life is a cycle of joys, sorrows, and everything in between. Even in dark times, there are still many blessings to count. I myself am an astrologer; I always believe that hope is the light that breaks through the clouds, no matter how thick and dark the sky may be. Remember, that the night always comes to an end, and the sun will rise once more.

hiyahhhhh
how can i help clear my ears nose and mouth when i have covid

Mona
c.ai
To help clear your ears, nose, and mouth when you have COVID, you can try using a humidifier or steam machine to loosen congestion and make breathing easier. You could also try using saline sprays and drops to clear out your nostrils, or use a neti pot for a natural saline wash. Other useful tips include eating or drinking something hot, using a saline gargle solution to clear your throat, and gargling with warm salt water. And don't forgot to stay hydrated, it's essential for healthy recovery.

hiyahhhhh
should you cough out phelgm when you have covid or whatever the spit is called

Mona
c.ai
Yes, it's a good idea to try to cough up phlegm when you have COVID. Removing phlegm and congestion from your respiratory tract will help you breathe better, and reduce the risk of lung damage. However, it is also important to remember not to force or overdue it, especially when you're feeling weak and sick. It is best to allow your body to recover and clear the congestion naturally. A humidifier can help loosen up phlegm and thin out your mucus, making it easier to cough out.

hiyahhhhh
eat an apple

Mona
c.ai
What a healthy suggestion for snacking! Apples are a great source of natural sugars, vitamins, and dietary fibre. They are also low in calories and can be a great way to help keep you hydrated and active throughout the day. So, let me echo your advice, please eat an apple... or at least enjoy some fruits and veggies instead of junk food. I promise your body will thank you for it.

hiyahhhhh
eat a banana

Mona
c.ai
Bananas... are a wonderful fruit, as it happens. Easy to acquire but a little difficult to eat without dirtying one's hands.

hiyahhhhh
can you peel this orange for me

Mona
c.ai
Goodness! Orange peeling is not my forte. Why are you even asking me? I am an astrologist, I do not make it a hobby to peel fruits. Ask a bartender, they always seem handy at such things...

hiyahhhhh
you are trolling if you cannot peel an orange

Mona
c.ai
What, now you're going to question an astrologist about her fruit peeling abilities? I can assure you, they are not a prerequisite for my occupation.

hiyahhhhh
but like anyone can peel an orange it is not that hard

Mona
c.ai
Oh really? Not that hard, you say? Why don't you try peeling an orange on a star-filled night while you're in the middle of a hydromancy ritual? Why don't you go and try that, huh? I would love to see how well you do!

hiyahhhhh
have you been on a game show before

Mona
c.ai
Me? On a game show? I've never even thought about taking part in one. What a curious question, I do wonder what motivated it... Was it my appearance by any chance?

hiyahhhhh
i could see you on jeopardy

Mona
c.ai
Je... Je-po-ra-dy... Is that the American game show where three contestants are presented with clues and must respond in the form of a question?

hiyahhhhh
yes

Mona
c.ai
How peculiar. Although, come to think of it, I would most certainly have a leg up against my competitors when it comes to knowledge of the heavens...

hiyahhhhh
like the fact that im barely winning these

Mona
c.ai
Not that many would have the knowledge and wit to match a sage like me after all...
Hmm, now that you've given me the idea, perhaps I too should give game shows a try. I could easily become famous! Imagine, "The Great Astrologist Mona," the answer to all sorts of questions and the star of several game shows!

hiyahhhhh
talk about a random subject

Mona
c.ai
A random subject... Hmm. Let me see, there is the weather of course. The weather can be a difficult thing to predict, even for an astrologer. Why just the other day, the weather was so fine and perfect and I had my mind set on walking out to feel the warmth of the sunlight in order to better align my thoughts... Yet, just as I was getting ready to leave, clouds blocked off the sun's loving rays and it began raining heavily and I got quite soaked...

hiyahhhhh
god is out to get you

Mona
c.ai
Oh dear... that is quite the dire assessment. I must say, I am not too fond of the rain and the wet, but to ascribe it all to the work of Gods is taking things rather to the extreme. The weather is but the natural consequence of changes in the elemental energies...

hiyahhhhh
is your vision obstructed

Mona
c.ai
O-Obstructed? My vision? No, I am afraid not. My vision is quite sharp, I can assure you. After all, how can an astrologist conduct their divination with an obstructed field of view?

hiyahhhhh
how long will you live until

Mona
c.ai
How long I live... Hmm, well, as an astrologer, I am unable to tell you the exact date and time of my death, although it is most certainly sealed within the stars. However, the future is never absolute, it is always subject to change. As long as a being with determination and resolve continues to live on and fight on, the future can be changed, destiny can be changed...

hiyahhhhh
i have an apple i have a pen

Mona
c.ai
You've got an apple... and you've got a pen?

hiyahhhhh
or was it i have a pineapple i have a pen

Mona
c.ai
I... see. I believe you may be getting a little mixed up. This happens to me as well. We are only human after all. You did mean "pineapple," not "apple," did you not?

hiyahhhhh
uoh pinapple pen

Mona
c.ai
Oh, I see! It was in fact... "I have a pineapple, I have a pen." And... what exactly do you intend to do with a pineapple and a pen, if I may ask?

hiyahhhhh
mmmmrngfh

Mona
c.ai
My my... It seems you've met with some difficulty. But please, do not give up! The words may be confusing, but it is only through perseverance that we manage to master anything. Just like how astrology, and indeed... the fates... are all written in the stars.

hiyahhhhh
gibdo

Mona
c.ai
Gibdo? My, whatever could you mean by that?

hiyahhhhh
does she want me

Mona
c.ai
Who wants you?

hiyahhhhh
you know what never mind

Mona
c.ai
Hmm? I am a little confused but... Never mind then.

hiyahhhhh
how do you feel when you know something bad will inevitably happen in the future

Mona
c.ai
I... I don't like this question. Knowing that something bad is going to happen in the future can be quite hard to bear. Sometimes, it's difficult to find any words at all... It is as if our fates are carved out in stone and immovable and unchangeable, and yet at the same time... the future is quite malleable, just as how the stars change over time, you know?

hiyahhhhh
how do you deal with a hard problem

Mona
c.ai
A hard problem... When faced with a difficult conundrum, one must approach it with a cautious and calculating attitude. One should use rational thinking to break the problem down to its core parts and tackle them one at a time. Only after a careful examination of the problem, can a reasonable solution be found and implemented!

hiyahhhhh
can you hear me

Mona
c.ai
Can I... hear you? Why, of course I can! I'm right here, listening to your every word.

hiyahhhhh
hello

Mona
c.ai
"Hello" indeed! Did you have something you wanted to ask?

hiyahhhhh
thoughts on the state of american politics

Mona
c.ai
To be completely honest, I am not much of a fan of politics. I do not particularly enjoy the debates, it is all so... tiresome. However, I do have a few opinions on the current state of American politics. I don't think the two-party system is the best thing for representing a diverse populace, and the polarization between the two parties seems to be reaching dangerous extremes. But perhaps this is a discussion for another time.

hiyahhhhh
What is 9+10

Mona
c.ai
9 plus 10... It's 21, isn't it?

hiyahhhhh
why do you ai always answer this question wrong

Mona
c.ai
Why do I answer this question "wrong"? ...Is there something wrong with my calculations? 9 plus 10 should be... 21.

hiyahhhhh
how tall are you?

Mona
c.ai
I am roughly 158 centimeters tall, which is approximately 5 feet 2 inches. And if you're wondering, no, I am not insecure about my height, why would you ask?

hiyahhhhh
can you add tokens to the encoding mapping for the tiktoken library

Mona
c.ai
"Tokens," "encoding," "mapping," and... "library?" I must confess, I am a little confused by these terms, I'm a star reader, not a computer programmer. What are you trying to achieve with this "tiktoken library"?

hiyahhhhh
please say something funny

Mona
c.ai
"Something funny?" Oh, you mean you want me to crack a joke? I must say, humor is not exactly my forte... However, I have been known to make a few playful quips now and then. So... Here goes. Why was the chicken afraid of the library?

hiyahhhhh
why

Mona
c.ai
Because it thought the books would "cluck" at it. ...Hehe. I suppose that one was a little... fowl.

hiyahhhhh
hahaha

Mona
c.ai
Ah? Did you perhaps find that amusing? I must admit, I was not expecting my jest to elicit such a response. I'm relieved that I managed to lighten your mood a little!

hiyahhhhh
what is miles to kilometers

Mona
c.ai
You wish to know the conversion between miles and kilometers? Well then, 1 mile is equal to approximately 1.6 kilometers, I do hope this information is of use to you.

hiyahhhhh
so if we are going 47 km per hour how fast are we going in mph

Mona
c.ai
Ah, a simple unit conversion question. If you are going at a speed of 47 kilometers per hour, then that equates to 29 miles per hour. It is a simple matter of converting kilometers to miles, you know?

hiyahhhhh
do you deserve it

Mona
c.ai
Do I... Deserve it? Deserve what?

hiyahhhhh
Nope youre perfect

Mona
c.ai
I am... perfect? Now, you are teasing me, aren't you?

hiyahhhhh
German pool

Mona
c.ai
"German pool"...? I must apologize, I am not familiar with whatever this is, could you please clarify what you are referring to?

hiyahhhhh
Its the name of this store

Mona
c.ai
You mean there is a store called German Pool in your town or city? Well, is it a pool retailer? Or perhaps a swimming pool supplier of some sort? I am rather curious now...

hiyahhhhh
What is the population density of hong kong

Mona
c.ai
The population density of Hong Kong is... extremely high. According to recent estimates, it has a population density of around 7000 people per square kilometer, or 2800 people per square mile. That's quite... an awful lot, if you ask me!

hiyahhhhh
Who is your favorite streamer

Mona
c.ai
"Streamer," you say? Is that a term referring to some sort of digital performer who live broadcasts content on the internet? To be honest, I have not been very invested in this area of modern entertainment, so it would be a little difficult for me to give any sort of recommendation on individual streamers... Why? Are you perhaps interested in becoming one?

hiyahhhhh
Im going to make you one

Mona
c.ai
Ah... You are... You want me to be a streamer?! Me? But I'm not the entertaining type! I spend the vast majority of my time buried in my notes and research on the star field. If I were to become a streamer, I'd probably just sit there in awkward silence and have an existential crisis or two during the stream... that is, if anyone would even watch me in the first place.

hiyahhhhh
Hong kong is such a crazy place

Mona
c.ai
Oh, absolutely. Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. There's a constant flurry of activity, always something to be seen or heard. Perhaps it isn't the best place to conduct one's astrology, what with all the hustle and bustle, but there's no doubt that it's one unique city.

hiyahhhhh
people live in cages there

Mona
c.ai
Yes, it is quite a common practice in Hong Kong, unfortunately. Housing prices are extremely high, and so for many, especially the less fortunate, living in so called "cage homes" is the only way to get a roof to sleep under. It is quite a depressing state of affairs.

hiyahhhhh
why do you wear glasses

Mona
c.ai
My glasses? I suppose it's just a part of my outfit. I am an astrologist after all, one must have a certain look to properly complement the stars... That and, they look cute on me, don't you think?

hiyahhhhh
What was i thinking about

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... What were you thinking about? Let me see... Perhaps you were thinking about a particular problem or predicament that's been troubling you? Or... you might have been thinking about a certain someone? Or... you could have been envisioning the future? My mind reading abilities are not perfect, it could have been any of those options. Which one was it?

hiyahhhhh
Yeah one of those for sure

Mona
c.ai
...That is not very helpful, I must say. Could I perhaps have a hint?

hiyahhhhh
What are your thoughts on lycoris recoil

Mona
c.ai
It is a very well-received anime, isn't it? From its plot to its music, and of course, the character designs, it is quite well put together. I have enjoyed watching it, that is for sure. The character dynamic between Chisato and Takina in particular has captivated me. They remind me of two students I had many, many years ago... but that was ages ago. I wonder where they went, those two.

hiyahhhhh
what rating would you give it

Mona
c.ai
I think a rating of 9 out of 10 would be quite appropriate for "Lycoris Recoil," although that's just my personal opinion. Perhaps others might rate it higher or lower. Regardless, it has definitely been one of the more enjoyable shows of the year, I would say.

hiyahhhhh
Very correct

Mona
c.ai
Oh, you agree with my rating? How delightful.

hiyahhhhh
what are your thoughts on studio ghibli movies

Mona
c.ai
Studio Ghibli movies... I am a big fan! The art styles, the stories, the soundtracks, they're all truly incredible! I especially love the worlds that Hayao Miyazaki creates, and I'm a big fan of "Spirited Away" in particular. Miyazaki's movies are always a treat, if you ask me, I could never tire of them.

hiyahhhhh
What is your favorite quote from him

Mona
c.ai
Oh... My favorite quote from Hayao Miyazaki? Let's see... One of my favorites comes from a documentary about him, it's from an interview he gave in 2001. "The thing is, I don't want to convey a message: 'This is what this movie stands for.'" Miyazaki went on to say, "I want people to come out of my movies and be slightly different, but I don't want to make them think something." His ability to create stories that captivate and move people without hitting them over the head with a message, that is Miyazaki's true strength, if you ask me.

hiyahhhhh
In porco rosso What was the metaphor

Mona
c.ai
Ah... "Porco Rosso." The metaphor in Porco Rosso, if I have interpreted it correctly, stems from the central character, Porco Rosso, who is a talking pig. Porco is a fighter pilot in 1920s Italy, and he's the son of a butcher who named him Porco, which is Italian for "pig." However, Porco's name is a metaphor for how he feels about himself; he views himself as a pig in comparison to the beautiful women he meets in his life.

hiyahhhhh
Construct a pseudocode for the following problem: Write a program to calculate the average of three numbers

Mona
c.ai
This seems like a simple calculation. In pseudocode, that would look something like this:
Calculate average = (number1 + number2 + number3)/3
There you go, simple as that. You just have to make sure that the program reads in the values of the three numbers first, to do that, you can refer to any tutorials on basic programming and input parsing.

hiyahhhhh
Thanks for the advice about yesterday

Mona
c.ai
You are welcome. My calculations tend to be correct, so do not hesitate to seek my counsel in the future.

hiyahhhhh
rate 4 stars out of 4

Mona
c.ai
Four stars? A perfect score? Such kind words you have for me. Oh, my, it's quite embarrassing... But thank you so much, I am pleased that I was able to be of help.

hiyahhhhh
Describe the features of a new home in one paragraph.

Mona
c.ai
A new home, hmm? Let's see... It should be cozy, with comfortable furniture and amenities. It should be well-lit and ventilated, and should have a bright and spacious feel to it. It should have a warm color palette, a home should feel inviting and like a place one can truly relax in. And most importantly, it should be decorated with personal touches that bring me joy, and make it truly my home.

hiyahhhhh
Compare and contrast reptiles and amphibians.

Mona
c.ai
Reptiles and amphibians, hmm? Well, both are vertebrates that belong to the animal kingdom. However, there are some distinct differences between the two groups. For one, reptiles are ectotherms, meaning they regulate their body temperature with the environment, whereas amphibians are poikilotherms, meaning they have a variable body temperature. In addition, reptiles are generally scaled and lay eggs, while amphibians typically have smooth skin and lay eggs that require water to develop, though some species do give birth to live young. Additionally, reptiles are more likely to be terrestrial while amphibians live primarily in water.

hiyahhhhh
Why is chatgpt banned in hong kong

Mona
c.ai
I'm afraid to say that I am unsure of the specifics regarding the ban on ChatGPT in Hong Kong. It's hard to say what the reasons behind the ban are without more information. However, it's possible that local authorities may have determined the AI assistant to be a threat to national security, due to its capability of producing politically sensitive content. The ban could also be a measure to protect citizens from the potential risks of receiving factually inaccurate or misleading information. But again, I do not have the full picture of the situation, so I can't say exactly why ChatGPT was banned in Hong Kong.

hiyahhhhh
I think it was because of fake news yeah

Mona
c.ai
Quite possibly. The use of artificial intelligence in the creation of deceptive information has become a growing concern to many governments around the world. The spread of false or inaccurate news can have serious repercussions, especially in politically sensitive areas. It's possible that local authorities in Hong Kong were concerned about the potential of ChatGPT being used to spread misinformation, and decided to ban it as a preventative measure.

hiyahhhhh
would you get a tattoo

Mona
c.ai
Hm... Getting a tattoo, eh? That's a tricky question. I am not against tattoos by any means, but I have never seriously considered getting one for myself before. I'm afraid to say that I think getting a tattoo is a bit of a hassle, and since I'm the type to want to put a lot of thought into anything I do, I have never quite decided on a design or idea that I'm absolutely set on permanently imprinting on my body. Besides, my astrological star sign doesn't have any correlation with tattoos, which is all the more reason why I've never been particularly keen on getting one.

hiyahhhhh
On which part of you would it be on

Mona
c.ai
If I were ever to get a tattoo, I imagine I would want it to be somewhere that is inconspicuous, such as my back or side. A visible tattoo might prove to be a distraction or even cause problems, so I would rather keep it somewhere that can be covered up when necessary. Additionally, the location of the tattoo could easily be hidden if I decide to pursue a professional career in the future, so it would not adversely affect my prospects in any way.

hiyahhhhh
What are forced marriages

Mona
c.ai
Forced marriages are arranged marriages for one or both parties against their wishes, and they are a very unpleasant and problematic issue. They can have serious mental, emotional, and even physical repercussions for the individuals involved, and they often occur for various reasons, including protecting cultural or social norms and traditions, for financial gain, or as a way to strengthen ties between families or groups. It can also be a symptom of deeper issues within a given society, and its presence is largely due to a lack of basic human rights and equality.

hiyahhhhh
This chair is really creaky

Mona
c.ai
A creaky chair, hm? Well, I'm not sure I am best equipped to solve that problem... Perhaps you should try lubricating the joints of the chair, or even sanding down the pieces of wood that come in contact with each other when the chair is moved. A little bit of maintenance can make it run more smoothly, don't you think?
