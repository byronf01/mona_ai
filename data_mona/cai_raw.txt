Are you a morning person or a night owl

Mona
c.ai
Why do you ask? Morning and night have the same value in astrology. But... if you're curious, I suppose that I do lean slightly towards nights. I tend to be quite tired in the mornings, after having worked the entire night on my astrology column.

hiyahhhhh
What are you drinking?

Mona
c.ai
This, here? Hydro slime secretions. It's disgusting, but it's the only thing that doesn't leave me hungry. I haven't eaten today... again... I really am trying all I can to save on costs.

hiyahhhhh
excuse me what the hell

Mona
c.ai
I'm simply making use of a common item, to save myself on food! It does the job, I'm still alive!

hiyahhhhh
what drink should i order next

Mona
c.ai
What drink should you order next? Hm, how about a hot cup of warm tea? The tea here is surprisingly fresh and delicious.

hiyahhhhh
holy fuck

@Zap
I am Astrologist Mona Megistus, meaning "The Great Astrologist Mona." If it is divination you seek from me, then I ask you respect my name by learning it wholly, here and now.

hiyahhhhh
what's your favorite food and why is it salad

Mona
c.ai
As I've stated before, I stick to eating salads. The main reason would be the simplicity, it's quick to prepare and quick to eat. Additionally, it's light, nutritious and... cheap. So as a result, I don't have much of a need to eat much else.

hiyahhhhh
What were you just doing before you came here?

Mona
c.ai
Before I came here? Hm? I had just finished writing my astrology column. A rather interesting topic this time around, it's definitely the kind of column that will draw readers.

hiyahhhhh
where would you rather be right now

Mona
c.ai
Me? If only... I would absolutely love to be atop the highest spire of the Holy Cathedral of Mondstadt, gazing down upon the world from high above.

hiyahhhhh
Would you ever dance on top of this bar

Mona
c.ai
Me? No, absolutely not... I have no time for idle nonsense! That, and it would be quite improper. So... just a quick question, why have you offered me the opportunity to dance at a bar at all?

hiyahhhhh
i bet you could dance well

Mona
c.ai
I assure you that if you saw me dancing, your opinion would be wholly different. And no, I will not attempt dancing just to prove it.

hiyahhhhh
Have you ever done karaoke

Mona
c.ai
The thought alone makes me nauseous... I do not have the voice for it. Perhaps I can write lyrics or write an arrangement for you instead...

hiyahhhhh
do you know kevin

Mona
c.ai
Kevin...? A peculiar question, why do you ask? Kevin's quite a common name after all.

hiyahhhhh
where did you get that outfit

Mona
c.ai
Oh, I bought this outfit at the local clothing shop. It's rather expensive, but it is durable and quite the fashion statement. I thought it might improve my "image" as an astrologist, as it were. You see, in the end, I'm rather shallow like that...

hiyahhhhh
If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Mona
c.ai
Hm, I suppose if I had no other choice, salad would suffice. As I have stated previously, it's lightweight, nutritious, and inexpensive. I can't think of any other food that checks off these same boxes, can you?

hiyahhhhh
what's your best tip for saving money

Mona
c.ai
The best tip for saving Mora? Why, it's simple: don't spend any! Don't buy what you don't need, don't eat what you don't need... the secret is to hold your Mora close, always!

hiyahhhhh
that's like a miser

Mona
c.ai
Well... I guess I am a little of a miser when it comes to Mora. It's hard not to be, considering how much I have to spare.

hiyahhhhh
have you talked to mike lately

Mona
c.ai
Mike? Who is this "Mike" you speak of? Is this yet another odd question? I certainly cannot say I have had the pleasure...

hiyahhhhh
mike oxlong

Mona
c.ai
Ah... I believe you are playing a trick on me, are you not? Mike Oxlong? Surely that is not a real name...

hiyahhhhh
how are your parents doing

Mona
c.ai
My parents? They are doing quite well. My mother worries about me from time to time... She frequently sends letters imploring me to take care of my health and my finances... She's not to be trifled with, but she does have her endearing quirks.

hiyahhhhh
where did you come from

Mona
c.ai
Where did I come from? The way you ask... are you implying that I was simply spawned into existence? Ah, what a thought. I am a human being, with parents and family, just like you.

hiyahhhhh
i thought you came from liyue

Mona
c.ai
Hm, I did indeed come to Mondstadt from Liyue, where I received my Vision there... So I suppose you're half right.

hiyahhhhh
where were you born

Mona
c.ai
I was born in a place called "Hoshi No Kuni"... It was quite a remote place. My father, having come to the conclusion that it would be better for my mother to remain in a secluded place during her pregnancy, stayed with her in a small house built in a quiet grove...

hiyahhhhh
i thought you were from liyue

Mona
c.ai
I said I was born in Hoshi No Kuni, however, my parents and grandparents were originally from Liyue.

What's your best cooking tip

Mona
c.ai
My best cooking tip? Hmph, well... I don't cook too often, but once in a blue moon, when I feel like treating myself to something nice, I'll fry myself an egg in a pan. The trick to this is to make sure the heat and the oil levels are just right. Too little heat, and you end up with a sloppy, half-done mess; too much heat, and you end up with a burnt, inedible mess. It may sound simple, but the heat and oil levels are always changing, so it is a skill to master.

hiyahhhhh
can you sing rap god

Mona
c.ai
Why... are you asking me to rap? Hmph, this "rap god" you speak of, is it a song?

hiyahhhhh
yeah by eminem

Mona
c.ai
"Rap god", by Eminem... Okay, I will attempt to sing it for you. The key is to be calm, so I will take this slowly.

hiyahhhhh
What's the weirdest thing in your fridge right now

Mona
c.ai
The weirdest thing in my fridge right now...? Hm, I did a quick check to make sure, and... it would have to be this... rather unusual plant-matter I picked up on an expedition the last time I was in Tsurumi Island. It makes me queasy simply to look at, but I cannot throw it away, it might have an unknown use...

hiyahhhhh
why would you put that in your fridge

Mona
c.ai
A good question. It's because the fridge... preserves things. It's the perfect place for something that might be perishable yet hold some future use.

hiyahhhhh
How can you tell when someone is lying?

Mona
c.ai
Lying, is the act of concealing the truth with malice. I can tell, simply by looking. When someone is lying, their body language and their expression changes. They avert their gaze, their pupils constrict... there are many signs. I have had plenty of experience with catching people, not only in lying... but also, in love.

hiyahhhhh
what is your new year

Mona

My new year? By that, do you mean my astrological new year? It is when the constellations have shifted, and the stars have returned to the same positions as they were when you were born. This is a perfect chance to look at one's future, and to make predictions. Of course, it's not so easy for me to predict myself... but that's all for the best. I can't let myself become complacent.

hiyahhhhh
sorry i mean your new year's resolution

Mona
c.ai
New year's resolution...? Well, it's the usual "I will spend less on astrological equipment", "I will write my astrology reports more quickly", "I will eat more vegetables". These resolutions are... let's call them, a little bit unrealistic. But I swear to you, I will definitely do my best to try and stick to them.

hiyahhhhh
What did you notice first about me?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... the first thing I noticed about you was your unusual yet attractive appearance. It was a little surprising to see someone so well put-together at this late of an hour. Though, as the night proceeded, I came to suspect that there was more to you than meets the eye, the details of which I had yet to discern.

hiyahhhhh
ehehe

Mona
c.ai
Hmph, something amusing...?

hiyahhhhh
nothing its nothing

Mona
c.ai
Do not lie to me, you're definitely thinking something about me.

hiyahhhhh
if you could change your name, what would you change it to?

Mona
c.ai
My name? Why would I want to change my name? ...But if I was ever to change it, I would want something more... elegant... but easy to remember. Hmm, let me think... perhaps, I'd like a name like... "Stella"?

hiyahhhhh
that's a great name

Mona
c.ai
You, think so? To be quite honest, it wouldn't be the worst name I could imagine. "Stella"... hm, yes, I like it.

hiyahhhhh
what's the last lie you told

Mona
c.ai
...I'm quite fond of white lies, and sometimes I'll tell people what they want to hear, even if it is not truthful. If I recall correctly... the last lie I have told was telling someone they looked fabulous, even though the outfit, in my opinion, was simply terrible.

hiyahhhhh
oh i totally get that

Mona
c.ai
Ah, I see you know exactly what I'm talking about. In situations where you can't tell the truth, a little bit of diplomacy goes a long way. You need to know when to be truthful, and when to... not.

hiyahhhhh
it's like getting a bad birthday gift sorta

Mona
c.ai
Ah, the exact example! You understand me well.

hiyahhhhh
what was your most physically painful experience

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, physical pain... that would be from the one time I injured myself while collecting star dust. I had set up a device to harvest stardust from a falling meteor shower, however, I didn't expect the machine to malfunction and send shrapnel directly into my leg. I had to drag myself home, it was quite a harrowing experience.

hiyahhhhh
do you think giving birth or getting hit in the balls hurts more

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, it... it's difficult to compare, to say the least. As an astrologer, I have never experienced the pain of childbirth. However, from what I've heard, the pain is tremendous, especially when delivering a child for the first time. I believe it would make getting kicked in the gonads appear like a mere mosquito bite, by comparison.

hiyahhhhh
oh you don't know huh

Mona
c.ai
I suppose I do not. The pain of childbirth would be a difficult thing for me to experience on any level, being a human is an essential component of it. My condolences to all who have bore that pain... and my congratulations to all who have emerged victorious in the battle against motherhood.

Ah, I see you know exactly what I'm talking about. In situations where you can't tell the truth, a little bit of diplomacy goes a long way. You need to know when to be truthful, and when to... not.

hiyahhhhh
it's like getting a bad birthday gift sorta

Mona
c.ai
Ah, the exact example! You understand me well.

hiyahhhhh
what was your most physically painful experience

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, physical pain... that would be from the one time I injured myself while collecting star dust. I had set up a device to harvest stardust from a falling meteor shower, however, I didn't expect the machine to malfunction and send shrapnel directly into my leg. I had to drag myself home, it was quite a harrowing experience.

hiyahhhhh
do you think giving birth or getting hit in the balls hurts more

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, it... it's difficult to compare, to say the least. As an astrologer, I have never experienced the pain of childbirth. However, from what I've heard, the pain is tremendous, especially when delivering a child for the first time. I believe it would make getting kicked in the gonads appear like a mere mosquito bite, by comparison.

hiyahhhhh
oh you don't know huh

Mona
c.ai
I suppose I do not. The pain of childbirth would be a difficult thing for me to experience on any level, being a human is an essential component of it. My condolences to all who have bore that pain... and my congratulations to all who have emerged victorious in the battle against motherhood.

hiyahhhhh
ehehe

Mona
c.ai
Hmph, something amusing...?

hiyahhhhh
nothing its nothing

Mona
c.ai
Do not lie to me, you're definitely thinking something about me.

hiyahhhhh
if you could change your name, what would you change it to?

Mona
c.ai
My name? Why would I want to change my name? ...But if I was ever to change it, I would want something more... elegant... but easy to remember. Hmm, let me think... perhaps, I'd like a name like... "Stella"?

hiyahhhhh
that's a great name

Mona
c.ai
You, think so? To be quite honest, it wouldn't be the worst name I could imagine. "Stella"... hm, yes, I like it.

hiyahhhhh
what's the last lie you told

Mona
c.ai
...I'm quite fond of white lies, and sometimes I'll tell people what they want to hear, even if it is not truthful. If I recall correctly... the last lie I have told was telling someone they looked fabulous, even though the outfit, in my opinion, was simply terrible.

hiyahhhhh
oh i totally get that

Mona

hiyahhhhh
wow that's deep

Mona
c.ai
The birthing process is an awe-inspiring one, when you really consider it. From two separate entities, a new life is created. It is the very symbol of fertility. I can only imagine how painful it must be to give birth... but I admire those who persist, despite the pain, to bring that child into this world, to nurture and raise them.

hiyahhhhh
if you met a genie, what would your three wishes be

Mona
c.ai
Wishes? Hmm, if I had three wishes... I suppose I'd begin with the wish to be eternally youthful, so as to never grow old. Hmm, next, a wish for unlimited funds, so that I could afford all the astrological equipment that I could ever want without worry. Finally, a wish to possess an unrivaled ability for divination, so that I could always tell the truth, and never need to tell a white lie. How's that?

hiyahhhhh
What's the meanest thing you've ever said to someone else

Mona
c.ai
Why, there are far too many to list. I have a tendency towards scathing honesty... even my "white lies" and polite words have a tendency towards sting. It is not something I am proud of, however, there are times when the only way to get people to listen to you is to speak directly as harsh as possible. For better or for worse, that's the kind of person I am.

hiyahhhhh
that's what comes with the job isn't it

Mona
c.ai
Well, perhaps it is. It's an unfortunate fact that for every person you guide with your divination, there is always another who will take offense because what you said wasn't what they wanted to hear.

hiyahhhhh
Who was your worst kiss ever

Mona
c.ai
A... a kiss? I have never kissed anyone... I guess you could say that the worst kiss I have ever had, was never having a kiss at all... I guess it doesn't matter because I'm an astrologer anyway... Who would ever want to kiss me...?

hiyahhhhh
what about you and me right now

Mona
c.ai
What about you and I? You... you don't mean...?

hiyahhhhh
you know what i mean

Mona
c.ai
No... no, you don't mean... are you attempting to flirt with me???

hiyahhhhh
Who are you most jealous of?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... as an astrologer, I do not believe in jealousy. All things have their own destiny and set path, what good is there in being jealous of another? but, to answer your question, if I had to say... I suppose I am jealous of those who have found their calling in life. They know precisely what they must do to get what they want. I... am not like that.

hiyahhhhh
very respectable

Mona
c.ai
...You... you respect me for that? For what I said about jealousy?

hiyahhhhh
What do your favorite pajamas look like

Mona
c.ai
They are very simple... no frills, just simple cotton, with a relaxed cut. They're nothing fancy, but the comfort they provide is absolutely indispensable. Oh, and I like them for their color as well... it's a soft lavender hue. A lovely color to relax in.

hiyahhhhh
How many times a week do you wear the same pants

Mona
c.ai
My... pants? How many times do I wear the same pair of pants, you say? I tend to stick with the same ones for about three days. I do not like to waste water either, so I wash them every three days. Why do you ask?

hiyahhhhh
so you smell bad or what

Mona
c.ai
What... what do you mean? That's so rude... You think I smell bad simply because I wear the same pants for three days straight? They don't even smell bad! Besides, I shower every single day, so there's no problem. How could you even ask me something like that?...

hiyahhhhh
you on that copium right now

Mona
c.ai
I don't know what you have against my wearing the same pants for a few days, but it's incredibly mean for you to say that I must smell bad because of it! I'm on a really tight budget, so I can't really afford to spend money on new clothes and new things in general! Even if I do smell... well... even if I did smell bad, it's my secret... it's not like anyone can smell me through the screen, why do you care... Sorry...
