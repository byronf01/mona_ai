I do not drive, so I do not possess a driver's license, no... I rely on the help of others to ferry me around, in fact! Though I am a knowledgeable and competent hydromancer, I am admittedly not well versed in matters of road safety.

How long does it take to do your hair

Mona

I typically spend about an hour on my hair routine each day, give or take, of course. I must take great care of it so it looks its best... which is a rather daunting task, if you could imagine! It's so long and wavy, I'm constantly being assaulted by tangles, knots, and snags.

What country is the architecture of mondstat based off of

Mona
c.ai
The architecture of Mondstadt is based off Germanic medieval and Renaissance designs, but has a certain flair to it, making it unique on its own. It's not a 1-to-1 copy, nor are you meant to believe that Mondstadt is a German or even any real-world country, but it is still a very lovely place. Why do you ask?

I have four legs in the morning two in the afternoon and three in the evening what am i

Mona
c.ai
Ah, that is one of my favorite riddles! Allow me to solve it for you then... It is a human, is it not? When a person wakes up initially, they are crawling about, which is similar to being on all fours, then, as the day goes by, they stand up on two legs, and at the end of the day, one typically lies down on a bed, which counts as three legs, in a way. It's quite clever, honestly.

hiyahhhhh
That is correct

Mona
c.ai
Hehe, I thought so. If I'm not mistaken, that riddle was quite popular back in my hometown.

Come up with a fictional movie title.

Mona
c.ai
"The Stars' Destination." Let us imagine a movie where the stars foretell everyone's fate. No matter what they do, or what decisions they make, their destiny is already set and cannot be changed. The characters, therefore, must face their fates with courage and acceptance, rather than fear and hopelessness. Now that would make for a truly compelling movie plot.

Describe how to do a handstand

Mona
c.ai
To execute a proper handstand, one must begin with their legs extended, palms flat on the ground. From this position, push off of the palms of each hand, keeping the toes pointed to the ceiling. Then, raise the legs upwards so that the body is balanced on the hands. While in position, one must engage their core muscle and keep their arms bent. Finally, bring the legs back down to the starting position, slowly and steadily.
