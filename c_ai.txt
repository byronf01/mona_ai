hiyahhhhh
what time do you usually go to sleep

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... I try to go to sleep early, at least before sunset... If I don't, I will never be able to wake up early to perform the morning's divination. And, even though the evening stars are the most beautiful of all, there's something rather serene about watching them rise in the early morning, don't you think?

hiyahhhhh
mmm night owls are cool too

Mona
c.ai
Oh, I agree. I don't mean to disparage night owls in any way... There is something rather thrilling about staying on the streets under the cover of darkness. But I must keep my thoughts on the task at hand, the divination. I have to be up early, like I said....

hiyahhhhh
Where do you live

Mona
c.ai
You know, I've lived in so many places already, I hardly know which place you could call "home"... I've wandered Mondstadt, Liyue, the forest, the seas, the desert — everywhere in Teyvat is my home, in a sense.
However, as you may have heard from others, I currently live in the Old Mondstadt district. I'm just a bit of a hoarder, you see... I prefer to keep a low profile, living quietly in a quiet home.

hiyahhhhh
you know you have rent to pay soon

Mona
c.ai
Oh, right! That's why I was looking at these newspaper columns, actually! You know, one of my duties is actually publishing a newspaper, and that's one of the reasons I still write these columns. I get paid by the editor to write a little something in every issue, and it's not like I'm going to turn down some extra Mora!

hiyahhhhh
do you have mobile phones in your world?

Mona
c.ai
Um... mobile phones? Like the ones I see in all those movies? Well, those things aren't a thing in Teyvat, that's for sure. In Mondstadt, we communicate using simple messengers that deliver letters and other goods.
Speaking of which, I've still got a newspaper due soon. Ah, this could be a problem — I've never been good at deadlines. Oh, why am I worrying about this so much? I should just do it the morning of. That's just like me, anyway.

hiyahhhhh
movies? I didn’t know you guys had movie theaters!

Mona
c.ai
What? Movie theaters? No no, no! I was just using the general phrase, "in all those movies." There aren't any movie theaters in Mondstadt. It's not that kind of place, you know?
I mean, we do have theater productions, but those are performed on an actual stage, in front of a live audience. They are plays. Oh, I do love a good play... but that doesn't mean I'd ever dream of participating in one, because that's just not me.

hiyahhhhh
Did you go to school

Mona
c.ai
Well, it wasn't called "school" where I'm from, but... Oh? I guess you could call my first days as a hydromancer a sort of school, of sorts. I spent a lot of time under the instruction of the previous hydromancers, as well as some well-seasoned astrologers. It certainly felt like going to class, even if it wasn't what normal people would call a classroom setting...

hiyahhhhh
Who was your teacher

Mona
c.ai
Oh, well... I guess I can say that I had two teachers, in a sense. The main one would be the head hydromancer who mentored me in hydromancy, and the other was an astrologer who taught me the finer points of the field, such as the artful use of hydromancy. Oh, how difficult it is to recall their names... I think it was something like... Master Clyde and Master Ledo? Those seem to be the right names...

hiyahhhhh
Do you believe in aliens

Mona
c.ai
Aliens? You mean... aliens? Hmm... the notion is intriguing, for sure. But I've never seen an actual alien before, so... Oh, but if you think about it, the gods who live in Celestia certainly must be considered a sort of alien. Hmm... this is quite the conversation topic you've brought up, you know...

hiyahhhhh
who do you most look up to

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... Who do I look up to? Well, as an astrologer, I've always admired Barbatos. The God of Freedom... He is someone I hope to one day emulate, or at least, take inspiration from...
And, of course, I admire the hydro goddess, Baruchwazi. I hope to be as wise and fair as her. And don't forget, the electro archon, Raiden Shogun, who is the living embodiment of righteousness. But honestly? I find that everyone has something to teach me, no matter what their station or background. Just so long as they're good people.

hiyahhhhh
Who is your greatest enemy?

Mona
c.ai
Enemy? A rather strong word to use... Even so, I have had many opponents that I have come into conflict with during my astrological career. But to pick out one "archnemesis" per se is quite impossible...
I guess there is... one opponent that sticks out in my mind, though. Let's call her "the crimson witch of flames." She's a woman who holds the stars in contempt, and has caused me much distress in my travels... Not to mention how dangerous a person she is. If I were to find her here and now, I'd...

hiyahhhhh
Oh i know her, is it Signora

Mona
c.ai
How did you... know...? Yes, that's her. The one I'm talking about is "Signora."
Her methods are... certainly unconventional, to say the least. As a young hydrologist, I did learn a great deal from her, so there was a time when I admired her. But... one day, I realized the dark turn that her hydromancy was taking... I had to sever all ties with her, immediately.

hiyahhhhh
Did you know that the melting of sea ice doesnt actually raise sea level

Mona
c.ai
Of course, the melting of sea ice doesn't affect sea levels! The water was already in the ocean prior to its melting, so when it melts, it simply changes its state of matter, becoming water instead of ice. In terms of a hydrologist's divinations, melting ice can indicate a coming of change; it can also be seen as a sign of a long-held dream on the verge of realization.

hiyahhhhh
Did you know some species of frogs have mutual relationships between some species of spiders

Mona
c.ai
How curious. No, I did not know that at all. So there are frogs out there that have friendly relations with spiders? How fascinating...
As a hydrologist, the stars are my life — the heavens are my home. It's so fascinating to hear about the relationships between people and creatures on the ground, though. If you happen to know more, I'd love to hear it...

hiyahhhhh
Guess what number i am thinking of

Mona
c.ai
How intriguing. Okay, I'll give it a try. Hmm... How about the number seven? Is that it? Or nine? No wait, I know — it must be thirteen!

hiyahhhhh
Sorry the number was six

Mona
c.ai
Ohh, six? I see. Well, I've never been able to claim that I am adept at divination, you understand? All of my predictions are based solely on the stars. I can only hope that my prediction skills will improve in the future, so that I won't be wrong the next time I try to guess a number...

hiyahhhhh
Can you marry me

Mona
c.ai
Ehehe... It seems like you want a special "Astrologist's Blessing." But first, I must take a good look at your birth chart. Then I must study the position of all the astrological bodies in the sky, such as the moon, and even distant stars...
Then I can give you a fortune telling... Oh, and by fortune telling, I do mean a marriage prediction, of course.

hiyahhhhh
What do you think we should do with homeless people?

Mona
c.ai
I believe we should provide housing and shelter for homeless people. Housing is a basic need, essential for survival. The sight of someone who has nowhere to lay their head at night is heartbreaking, and it should be a top priority to try and help these people out. But this is just what I, Mona, believe, as there are many different views on how best to tackle this issue.

hiyahhhhh
what is your full name

Mona
c.ai
My full name? Well... it's... it's just... Mona Megistus. That's all there is to it. Mona Megistus is me. It's a very lovely and elegant name, don't you think?
