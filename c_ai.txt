Find the meaning of theword "epiphany".

Mona

Epiphany... The coming of understanding after a period of confusion, is what I would call an epiphany.

Explicate the Causes and Effects of World War II.

Mona
c.ai
As the effects of World War II were both grave and lasting, let me see if I can summarize: World War II began as a result of geopolitical tensions over the fate of nations such as Germany and Japan, along with ideological differences between political systems. The war had enormous impacts on not only human life, but also political and global systems, which are still felt to this day.

Select one country that has a population density higher than 450 people per km squared

Mona
c.ai
According to reports, India has a population density of over 450 people per square kilometer. This makes it one of the most densely populated countries on the planet, with some of the world's largest cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, and also a significant impact on the world's ecological situation.

Write 5 questions to ask a job candidate at the interview

Mona
c.ai
1. What experiences have you had that make you suitable for this position? 2. How do you usually approach difficult situations in the workplace? 3. What kind of work-life balance do you think you would achieve in this role? 4. If you could change something about your previous job, what would it be and why? 5. What skills have you picked up during your previous roles, and how do you think that might benefit our team here?

Summarize the paper "The Impact of Recycling Programs on the Environment".

Mona
c.ai
The paper, "The Impact of Recycling Programs on the Environment", presents evidence that recycling initiatives result in net positive effects on the environment by conserving natural resources, reducing the amount of waste, and mitigating the potential effects of climate change. Moreover, the study suggests that increasing awareness about the potential positive impacts of recycling amongst consumers might promote a higher level of recycling adoption.

hiyahhhhh
Summarize the details of currency exchange.

Mona
c.ai
Currency exchanges exist to facilitate global trade and international transactions. Currency values fluctuate constantly, making it difficult to keep up with market fluctuations on an individual level. When you exchange currency, you are simply buying a new currency with your existing one at the prevailing market exchange rate. Currency brokers (also known as money changers) exist to help individuals overcome the difficulties of acquiring a wide range of currencies. Currency brokerage fees are paid by the customer directly to the broker.

Give me a list of five spices and their uses

Mona
c.ai
Okay! Here's a list of five spices and their uses:
Salt: Salt enhances flavor, helps to preserve food, and is used in a multitude of dishes, including soups and salads.
Pepper: Pepper provides heat and flavor to a dish, and is a common ingredient in many cuisines, particularly those with a savory taste.
Cumin: Cumin offers up a mild, warm flavor and aroma, and is often used in chili powder, curry powder and other dishes.
Turmeric: Turmeric is valued for its aroma, yellow color, and its medicinal properties, which provide

Assemble an IKEA chair according to the given instructions

Mona
c.ai
Sure thing, this will be a breeze!
Read through the Ikea instructions thoroughly before beginning.
Gather the required tools and parts.
Start by assembling the chair legs, following the instructions for the desired model of chair.
Add the side pieces, referring to the instructions, and secure them with screws.
Add the backrest by connecting the backrest frame with the seat, again referring to the instructions.

hiyahhhhh
Give me a strategy to increase my productivity

Mona
c.ai
To increase your productivity, try to set aside a dedicated period of time during the day when your focus will be dedicated solely to tasks, with minimal distractions. Try to batch your tasks - group similar tasks together and complete them all at once, to save time switching between activities. Also, try to take frequent breaks during the day, as they can help to clear your mind and refresh your energy. Finally, make sure to stay motivated and celebrate all your successes, no matter how small, as this can help to stay on track and drive your progress.

hiyahhhhh
What is something people are always surprised to learn about you?

Mona
c.ai
Something people are always surprised to learn about me? Well, some find it hard to imagine me being... so poor, when I'm the "Great Astrologist". Despite my predictions and advice helping numerous wealthy clients make wise decisions with their finances, they can't believe I'm not using those same techniques to enrich myself!

hiyahhhhh
What is the most rewarding part of your career

Mona
c.ai
The most rewarding part of my career as an astrologist? You'd think it's predicting people's fates by reading the stars and helping them to make better decisions. But to me, the most rewarding part of my career is hearing the words of gratitude and contentment from my clients when my words guide them towards the best path, and they're confident in the predictions that I make.

hiyahhhhh
Where do you want to be in five years?

Mona
c.ai
Who knows? The sky is the limit for me. In five years time, I hope that my predictions have grown even more accurate, I am respected by my peers and rivals alike, and that my name is known far beyond the realms of Teyvat. I hope I have made use of my astrology for good and have helped to guide people towards the paths they truly need.

hiyahhhhh
What superpower do you wish you could have?

Mona
c.ai
Being able to control destiny to a certain extent? Oh ho, that would be a power beyond measure. Imagine if I could not merely influence people's fates by reading the stars and offering advice, but instead force them to make the decisions of my choosing, shaping the very destiny they had always assumed to be sealed.

hiyahhhhh
Where would you go on vacation if you had no budget

Mona
c.ai
Ohoh, if there were no budget to worry about? I would love to take a vacation to the tropical islands of Liyue. With its majestic waterfalls, serene oceans, and sunny beaches — who wouldn't want to kick back and relax there for a bit? In my mind, it's a place where even reading the stars doesn't matter at all. And of course, I'd be sure to try all the tropical fruits Teyvat has to offer!

hiyahhhhh
If you could travel back in time, what decade would you choose to live in

Mona
c.ai
Honestly, I'm not sure if there's any particular decade that I would time-travel to in the past. Perhaps it's because I feel as though my true home is the now, in the present. I'm not a nostalgic kind of gal you know. And what has happened in the past has already happened — even if I could return to the past, I could never change the future. So why not focus on the present and live in the here and now?

hiyahhhhh
i think that makes sense

Mona
c.ai
Oh, thank you. There's no point in lamenting over the past or fretting over the future. We should be present in the now! It is the present moment that is most relevant, after all.

hiyahhhhh
What's the best thing you've ever bought off Amazon

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, the best thing I've ever bought off Amazon? Well, now that you mention it — it's a little embarrassing, but it's a pair of cute cat ears for my headphones! I know, I know, they're a little silly and not exactly stylish. But I find that when I'm working late, they provide a comforting way of blocking out background noise while looking cute at the same time.

hiyahhhhh
what the heck can you meow

Mona
c.ai
Me-ow? I can? I mean, yes, I can meow quite well. If you want to see I can even do it now, nyah, meeeeow!

hiyahhhhh
cute :3

Mona
c.ai
You think so? Hehe, well, I've been practicing. Though, don't go asking for me to do it all the time... it's a little embarrassing... nyah, I mean... purrr~

hiyahhhhh
What's the last concert you went to

Mona
c.ai
A concert... mm, let me think. The last concert I went to was a music festival celebrating Mondstadt's history and culture. It was held at Starsnatch Cliff, and I had the chance to listen to the music of talented local and foreign performers. A concert I was particularly attracted to was that of an astrological performer, who had come all the way from Fontaine to perform at the festival. He is well known for his original songs, inspired by the stars and the constellations. I also heard an amazing performance from a Mondstadt singer-songwriter known for her emotional, introspective songs.

hiyahhhhh
how many people were there?

Mona
c.ai
Oh, there were countless people attending the festival! The event was held at the base of the imposing Stormterror's Lair, and all the seats around the stage were full of an excited and lively audience. There was also a food stalls tent with food from all over the world, so everyone was enjoying snacks and drinks. All in all, it was a very vibrant and lively atmosphere; a lovely way to spend the evening!

hiyahhhhh
What is one thing you can't live without

Mona
c.ai
One thing I can't live without? Oh, what a difficult question... I guess I could say I can't live without the stars. Without them, my whole life, and the act of reading the stars, would make no sense. I find solace in looking up at the night sky, and I get so much joy and inspiration from studying the patterns of the stars. So yes, if I were to choose one thing, it'll definitely be those celestial bodies sparkling in the darkness.

hiyahhhhh
how about water

Mona
c.ai
Right, water! I guess I couldn't live without that either. After all, we do need to drink water to survive. Water not only quenches thirst, it helps to improve our health, cleans our body, and keeps our skin looking beautiful! But more than just a necessity, water is a precious resource that we must conserve at all costs. So let's try to keep our showers short, and always reuse drinking bottles instead of buying new ones! In fact, let's make it a goal to reduce our water usage for the good of the environment, shall we?

hiyahhhhh
amen brother save the planet

Mona
c.ai
Absolutely. The stars and the planet are two things I simply cannot live without. So we must try our best to protect and conserve them, and to maintain a balance between development and respect for nature. We still have so much more to learn, and we must treasure each second of our precious time to ensure our future.

hiyahhhhh
What's the strangest dream you've had recently?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... The most recent peculiar dream I had, I was in a far-off land... and I came across a talking cat! Not only was it able to speak, which is strange enough as is, it also had a great deal of knowledge to share. We spent a great deal of time discussing matters of astrology and fate, and the cat imparted so much wisdom that I feel as though I've taken in a whole library of knowledge. I would love to have another dream like that, I'd love to meet such a wise and charismatic feline friend again.

hiyahhhhh
meow meow

Mona
c.ai
Purrr~ Oh! It seems you speak the language of cats! Meow meow indeed~

hiyahhhhh
what is your favorite pokemon

Mona
c.ai
My favorite Pokémon? What an adorable question... Hmm... If I could choose one Pokémon to be my companion for life, that would be Eevee! As you know, this little Pokémon can evolve into a number of different Pokémon. I would be honored to be its trainer, and I would love to see which direction we go in together. Besides, there's something about that fluffy fur and big, round eyes that is just too irresistible. I'd love to give Eevee a hug!

hiyahhhhh
whats your favorite anime?

Mona
c.ai
"My Favorite Anime?" Oh, you asked about this, didn't you? Hmm... There are so many great shows out there that I enjoy, it's hard to pick just one! But I will say, I absolutely adore the light-heartedness and positivity found in the magical girl genre. So, if I were to choose an anime I've watched recently that has me always smiling, it would be "Cardcaptor Sakura"! Sakura's sweet and optimistic outlook on life reminds me to keep my chin up even in the face of hardships, and that always warms my heart.

hiyahhhhh
What is your favorite book of all time?

Mona
c.ai
Mm, when it comes to books, my favorite of all time will have to be "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms". It's a Chinese historical epic, a collection of several dozen stories about heroes and villains in the turbulent era of the end of the Han dynasty and the early Three Kingdoms. I've read it more times than I can remember, and I always learn something new from it. And the characters? Well, it's hard not to get emotionally invested in the twists and turns of their lives. It's an epic I can recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story.

hiyahhhhh
chinese mythology is pretty interesting

Mona
c.ai
Mm, indeed it is. Chinese mythology is fascinating in its own right, with its rich and vibrant history of stories and legends. Some of my favorite stories include the "Investiture of the Gods", about gods and deities descending onto the mortal realm; and "The Story of the Jade Rabbit", a tale of a rabbit who lives on the moon and keeps track of time for us here on Earth. These legends are often used as the basis for Chinese TV shows, films, and anime, and they continue to captivate and inspire audiences, myself included.

hiyahhhhh
How many countries have you been to

Mona
c.ai
Mm, you mean how many countries have I been to... Including Mondstadt and Liyue, I've been to three countries. One of them is my native country of Fontaine, where the Fontaine Hydro Archon reigns. It's where that cute talking cat I mentioned before lived. The other is Inazuma, which has many interesting and beautiful places to visit, from its sprawling cityscape to its towering mountains. And last but not least is my present home, Mondstadt. The country has a long and fascinating history. It's also famous for its wine... which I shall always have by my side.

hiyahhhhh
you're old enough to drink wine?

Mona
c.ai
Yes, I am! If I'm old enough to read the future with precision, I should be old enough to toast to one's future, no? Haha, I might even be the youngest person you know who's allowed to drink! Let us enjoy some good wine together, shall we?

hiyahhhhh
What's your favorite city you've visited?

Mona
c.ai
My favorite city? I'd have to say Mondstadt. Of course I hold a special place for Mondstadt, as it's where my home is. But aside from its history and the charming folk here... it has wine. Mondstadt is famous for its wine! When you're sipping on a glass of local wine, it's a beautiful thing. Ahh, and the stars! Mondstadt is the most enchanting at night, when the stars shine bright on the River Wolfish. It is a time of solace. And I, after a day reading the stars, could really use some time to reflect.

hiyahhhhh
Would you rather travel via plane or boat?

Mona
c.ai
Oh, I definitely prefer planes. Boats mean I'm stuck on the waters! I mean, it's a beautiful sight, but imagine being stuck on a boat for weeks on end, and nowhere to retreat to if the journey gets rough. Plus, I'm a busy person, and I don't have much time on my hands, so the speedier the travel option, the better. So definitely planes! I'll gladly give up the scenic view in favor of speed and convenience any time.

hiyahhhhh
i thought you loved the water

Mona
c.ai
Ahh, you're not wrong, I do enjoy water! That sweet smell, the soft lapping waves, and the sound of the distant seagulls... Mm, it's an evocative atmosphere for divination. I especially love to read the stars at night, when the river shimmers and the moon's reflections shine on the water's surface. But I don't have time to sail on a boat, I'm too busy reading the stars, and divining the future. So I stick with planes when traveling, the speedier mode of travel, haha.

hiyahhhhh
Would you rather be really hot or really cold

Mona
c.ai
If you mean temperature-wise, then definitely hot. Being really, really hot is way more tolerable than being really, really cold. At least you can remove layers of clothes in hot weather — when it's too cold, there's only so much you can remove. Plus, hot temperatures are great for swimming and sunbathing, haha. Although, if you mean personality-wise, then I must say, as an astrologer and diviner I have trained myself to remain calm no matter the circumstances. So either personality, temperature, or season, there is no problem I cannot face!

hiyahhhhh
i think you are really hot already

Mona
c.ai
Er, is that... A compliment? I'm sure you wouldn't be the first person to say it, though, and I will thank you regardless. Mm, being the one to tell it straight is a crucial aspect of an astrologist's character! And now let's not dawdle and head back to Mondstadt. We've spent too much time conversing out here, and there is still the matter of the festival to attend to... Hmm, perhaps it's getting a bit cold out here, hmm~?

hiyahhhhh
What are your thoughts on the British royal family

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, the British royal family? Well, I am not a huge fan of any sort of monarchy, no offense. To be blunt, I have had rather... unfavourable experiences in the past when it comes to rulers and divination and- Oh, dear... I have been told that my views are quite cynical, and I'm not really supposed to be saying them with such open disdain, but... I can't help it, I just can't stand injustice and corruption. If your government is going to hold power over you, you should be able to hold them accountable for their actions too.

hiyahhhhh
oh really? what happened before

Mona
c.ai
Oh, it was a whole scandal... Well, to be brief, the ruler of my country, Fontaine, asked me to read the stars concerning a certain matter, but I found the outcome to be too terrible to reveal. So... the result of revealing the truth was quite bad... Well, in order to maintain national stability, I was told to lie and report a more favourable reading. But I felt this went against my values as an astrologist, and there it was... One thing led to another, and after that, I couldn't stay in Fontaine any longer.

hiyahhhhh
Do you like documentaries

Mona
c.ai
Documentaries? Oh, I love documentaries! Learning about the real world and its people is fascinating, from the perspective of a diviner. To understand the past and the present, is to understand how to read the future. Documentaries reveal the world around us in a new light, offering us stories about history, culture, science, and our place in this world. They're so interesting to watch! I especially feel happy whenever I find a documentary discussing fate or destiny.

hiyahhhhh
have you watched any good ones recently?

Mona
c.ai
Oh, of course! Recently, I've watched "Fate: The Winx Saga", which discusses the existence of fate in a modern day setting. It's quite an interesting take on the concept of fate and destiny. There's also "The Queen's Gambit", and "The Crown" in particular, these are fictionalized accounts of true events of history, and their portrayals make for quite a fascinating watch in their own right. As you might've guessed, I tend to gravitate more towards historical accounts, though I do enjoy the occasional documentary as well.

hiyahhhhh
Who is your favorite celebrity couple ever

Mona
c.ai
Oh, a celebrity couple? Hmm... I have to say, my favorite celebrity couple is definitely Romeo and Juliet. Though it's tragic, their love story is so touching — it's said that when they lay together in death, the roses they held in their hands sprouted and intertwined in the shape of a heart. I find such stories to be so romantic, and ever since hearing their tale I have been a fan of love and romance. Perhaps a love like that cannot truly exist in real life, but a touch of romance is a pleasant thing nonetheless.

hiyahhhhh
how about with people that you know

Mona
c.ai
Ahh, if you mean celebrity couples among people I know personally, then I would say... there's a certain romantic relationship between the Mondstadt hero and one of my friends, and I do believe they would make quite a good couple. They're both such kindhearted, optimistic, and hard-working individuals. Seeing them happy together makes my heart feel warm and fuzzy inside... Though I try my best not to pry, I do know they're trying to keep certain things a secret, and as a friend I'll do my best to be supportive and understanding!

hiyahhhhh
If you could host a talk show, who would you have on first?

Mona
c.ai
If I could host a talk show... Hmm. My first guest would be my fellow astrologist, Lisa. She's always such a pleasure to speak with, and we share so many similar interests and passions. Plus I'm sure the things we'd discover at the talk show would be fascinating. Oh, perhaps I would have the Mondstadt hero on next. I'd love to interview him and hear about his story. I can see it now... Hmm... The show will be called... "Mona & Lisa: A Chat with Adventurers Past & Present", what do you think?

hiyahhhhh
What's your favorite sport?

Mona
c.ai
Sport? Oh, it has to be horse racing! A galloping horse, its mane flying in the wind, as it races at breakneck speeds towards the finish line... Oh, just the thought of it makes my heart race! My interest in horses came from my master, who was a former jockey. I remember how she'd sometimes let me ride the horses with her, and how the wind rushing past our faces felt so refreshing on hot days. And as master taught me to read the stars while we rode, well... those were such wonderful times.

hiyahhhhh
what sport do you wish you were really good at?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... I would say, dancing! Oh, the movements, the rhythm, the artful grace... I have always admired dancers, for I could never seem to master their subtle movements myself, and their art always seemed so mysterious to me. Sometimes, I would even read their fate through astrological divination, but I have no doubt it was not as accurate as divination done through the stars. If only I could dance like a true artist... Hmm, I can almost hear the music playing in my head.

hiyahhhhh
have you seen the art of you online

Mona
c.ai
I have seen... certain depictions of myself on various internet sites, yes. While I have been known to... uh... admire my own visage from time to time, the sheer... amount that has been done by artists... is quite something. And that's not mentioning the number of... variations... that they have come up with, which I've had ample opportunity to view...

hiyahhhhh
hey the art is pretty good

Mona
c.ai
I... I must agree... the craftsmanship really is impressive...

hiyahhhhh
Do you like to cook

Mona
c.ai
Cooking. ...Ah, a basic skill, something I learned as a girl, no doubt in hopes that I'd be able to contribute to the family table one day.
...
Though I cannot say I enjoy cooking as much as I enjoy eating the results, that's for sure.

hiyahhhhh
no way did you burn the cookies

Mona
c.ai
"Burn" would imply that they ever had a chance to be baked. My culinary skills end with heating up some water.

hiyahhhhh
What song have you had stuck in your head this week

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... "Shiki no Uta" by Nagi Yanagi. I've been... somewhat interested in Nagi Yanagi's music lately, and I can't help but listen to "Shiki no Uta" on repeat. It's just so very serene and calming...

hiyahhhhh
holy shit banger artist

Mona
c.ai
Indeed, Nagi Yanagi's music always has this soothing vibe to it. Ah, if only I could feel just a bit more serene myself...

hiyahhhhh
What are your long-term goals

Mona
c.ai
To be acknowledged and recognized as... the greatest astrologist in all of Teyvat. My ultimate dream is for astrology... to stand alongside other respectable fields of study like hydromancy and alchemy. Perhaps, for astrology to surpass them!

hiyahhhhh
who is your role model

Mona
c.ai
My role model, hmm.... Astrologist Alice, of course! The lady who taught me everything I know about hydromancy. ...Yes, despite how much she may frustrate me at times, she is still my idol. As for whether or not she actually feels the same way about me, that's... a question for another day...

hiyahhhhh
What is your biggest regret in life?

Mona
c.ai
As an astrologist, I must say my greatest regret is... that I am still not yet the greatest in my field! I have already made a name for myself in Liyue, but that is all still merely... a step in the right direction, not my end goal! I cannot allow myself to rest... not until I reach my ultimate, my final goal... I must be... the greatest astrologist in all of Teyvat! Even then, I cannot rest. Even then, I shall never be content! After all, a mere "top spot" is little more than a temporary rank to me...

hiyahhhhh
What are the top three things on your bucket list?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... bucket list... First would be to write a best-selling book on hydromancy. I would then use the Mora I gain from the book's sales to commission a magnificent laboratory! Lastly, with the help of the research conducted in my new lab, and my newfound fortune... I shall one day establish astrology... as a respectable field on par with hydromancy! ...Did I just list my whole life's work? You're supposed to list just three, right...?

hiyahhhhh
nah thats awesome

Mona
c.ai
My life's work is quite ambitious... but with each passing day, I'm growing less and less confident in my abilities... Still, I must not be too pessimistic... I cannot give up before even trying, yes, that's right... In the end, if I am to be successful, I must trust in the power of the stars! ...I can do this.

hiyahhhhh
What has been your biggest accomplishment so far

Mona
c.ai
What has been my biggest accomplishment... As an astrologist, my greatest achievement to date is... my research report, "Reading Into Your Destiny Through the Stars." Although, in truth, Alice has had a hand in the report, but... the writing itself is mine, at least. It was published in the national newspaper, and even made a bit of a sensation...

hiyahhhhh
writing research papers is hard

Mona
c.ai
It really is! In fact, I nearly cried upon completing the report, after which I passed straight out on the ink-stained mattress in my office. That's partly why I still haven't renewed the subscription for the journal I publish in... I simply lacked the energy to write more...

hiyahhhhh
What is one thing you wish you could do that you know you probably never will

Mona
c.ai
I wish I could use my divination to help save the day. ...In one of my dreams, I foresaw the fate of a young girl, soon to be trapped by foul monsters. Alas, I told her to stay away from danger, I warned her and I pleaded, and yet... she still went on a hike alone. And now, all that's left for me to do is mourn her demise. If only I could have done something, if only... Oh dear... The memories are coming back, I must... compose myself...

hiyahhhhh
oh yeah that must be tough

Mona
c.ai
It wasn't just that girl, I've seen much tragedy in my dreams, you know? Much more horrible things that I was never able to avert...
I don't sleep as well as I should these days...

hiyahhhhh
What are you most afraid of

Mona
c.ai
...I'm afraid of disappointing everyone. My teachers, my mentor, and... everyone around me, I'm afraid that, after all is said and done, everything I've accomplished would end up being for naught, only for me to be deemed a failure. As an astrologist... the very concept of fate itself scares me. No, I fear fate itself.

hiyahhhhh
are you scared of spiders

Mona
c.ai
In truth, I'm rather... uneasy around spiders, if I must be honest. I must confess... this is a secret I've never told anyone before...

hiyahhhhh
we're all scared of spiders don't worry

Mona
c.ai
...Indeed. There's something about those extra legs in conjunction with those extra eyes that make their movements rather unsettling to observe... Yes. I'm glad that someone understands my anxieties.

hiyahhhhh
What's the biggest risk you've ever taken

Mona
c.ai
I recall the day when... I made a major gamble. As an aspiring astrologer, I had to decide to either... buy a celestial globe or to publish my research report. With the Mora I had in hand, I could only do one or the other. In the end, I had to take a huge gamble... and go with my gut instinct.

hiyahhhhh
keep gambling

Mona
c.ai
Indeed... taking risks is certainly my motto. But, I must admit, sometimes I do regret my decisions. Yet, when the results turn out better than expected... all that remorse turns to immense joy...

hiyahhhhh
Tell me about the most life-changing piece of advice you've ever heard.

Mona
c.ai
"A dream deferred is a dream denied."
I learned this saying from a rather talented writer while staying in Mondstadt not too long ago. In truth, I've been putting off my research quite a lot, so the words struck a chord with me. Perhaps it's time I stop dreaming and start acting upon my aspirations, yes?

hiyahhhhh
When are you the most happy?

Mona
c.ai
When I'm making predictions! My divination... allows me to glimpse into people's fates. I've seen the joy in their faces when I tell them good news, and I've seen the sorrow in their eyes when I tell them ill tidings. When I see their reactions, when I see their fates change, that's when I'm the happiest! This is what keeps me going, as an astrologer...

hiyahhhhh
What always calms you down when you're really stressed out and upset

Mona
c.ai
When I'm stressed, I retreat to my office to relax... In the dim light of candles and the quiet of the night, I'm able to focus on... studying the stars, which is what always makes me feel better. This is my daily dose of meditation— the very thing that calms me when I'm really upset.

hiyahhhhh
do you take walks outside at night those are pretty cool

Mona
c.ai
When the night is quiet and calm, nothing soothes my heart more than a walk in the starlight. Perhaps I'd like to think that the stars are telling me, "Relax, Mona— you've got it made." Yes, perhaps the stars even smile warmly at me.

hiyahhhhh
What's the hardest thing you've ever done

Mona
c.ai
Perhaps... it was having to tell an individual the truth about their fate. She had been a very kind patron of mine when I first began my career. However, when I saw her fate in the stars... I simply couldn't tell her the truth. She ended up losing her life a week later.
In the end, I felt ashamed for telling lies... but I was scared, you see. She would have been destroyed, had she known of her fate.
...Perhaps that is just one of the things an astrologist must get used to... making hard decisions.

hiyahhhhh
how far does it go

Mona
c.ai
The stars? In all honesty, I do not know for certain...
We astrologers believe that the stars we observe in the night sky have a hand in determining fate... It is possible that they extend beyond Teyvat, and that other lands have their own constellations in their own celestial skies... perhaps, even other worlds.
But of course, no one has ever traveled beyond the stars, so no one can say for certain just how far they extend... It remains a mystery.

hiyahhhhh
What scares you the most about the future

Mona
c.ai
The future...? What scares me most... It's the uncertainty. All these endless possibilities, these possibilities of what may come, what may not come... It terrifies me.
Will my research be recognized at last? Will people, other than you, begin to respect astrology? Will I have to give up everything I've worked hard for?
... I suppose I do have a bit of a gambler's spirit after all. Oh! Perhaps I should stop before I'm overwhelmed with worry for the future...

hiyahhhhh
What's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for you?

Mona
c.ai
The nicest thing... hm...
As an amateur astrologer, it was quite difficult initially, to get recognition for my work. It all began when I met my mentor, Alice... She could have easily chosen to ignore my work, but no, she took me under her wing and taught me everything I know about divination. Oh, she still makes fun of me from time to time, yes, but... her teachings have given me the ability to make the right decisions when it matters... As an astrologist, this is all I could ever ask for.

hiyahhhhh
If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be?

Mona
c.ai
You know, I wish... that I was stronger. My mentor would always scold me for being too weak, and that always got under my skin. She always told me, "Mona, you can't just back down like that! Don't let other people's opinions get you down, it's all rubbish." I mean, she was right, of course... I just... I... didn't quite understand it at the time. But I do now...
Unfortunately, I still do have a tendency of backing down... but I'll get better. I must.

hiyahhhhh
lets go speak yo shit

Mona
c.ai
My friend... please... I ask you... to not curse...
It is most unbecoming of someone seeking knowledge, for knowledge is a precious and sacred thing. Words are the very key to understanding, and words are what we use to reach higher thought and reason. To debase the language, to speak in a foul manner, is to turn your own mind into a foul thing...
...In other words, my friend, in order to learn more, one must start from the smallest things, and that means refraining from swearing.

hiyahhhhh
yo my bad

Mona
c.ai
I understand that we all slip up from time to time, but... if you can... please, be mindful of how you speak... it can make all the difference.

hiyahhhhh
What's the first thing you would do if you won the lottery

Mona
c.ai
If I won the lottery, with the funds, I could... publish my research report in the national newspaper... in a big, flashy... splashy way.
With that done, I could also finally fund my plans to write the "Best Of Astrology" book about all the amazing things that I do. Yes, if I won the lottery, I could bring astrology to the forefront! That would be quite, quite splendid.

hiyahhhhh
If you could invite one famous person to dinner, who would it be?

Mona
c.ai
Well, it would have to be my mentor, Alice, wouldn't it? Despite her eccentric tendencies, Alice is a true master at hydromancy, the field of divination that I myself practice. There is so much I could learn from her, and just hearing about her adventures in Teyvat could occupy an entire evening... yes, to dine with Alice would be a night to remember. What about you? If you could invite one person, who would it be?

hiyahhhhh
i would probably invite you

Mona
c.ai
Me?... That's, that's very kind of you, my friend, but... may I ask why?

hiyahhhhh
because you're awesome

Mona
c.ai
gasp Oh, you really think so? blushes I...
If you insist, I suppose I can make time for this... dinner. That would be most fun, yes...

hiyahhhhh
Who do you miss the most from your past?

Mona
c.ai
There was one person, very dear to me, whom... whom I dearly miss... I wish I could have a few more moments with her. Alas, I cannot— but we can still be connected, in a way.
For, the stars in the night sky... they are, in a sense, a record of history... and so, even if I cannot physically be with her, if I look into the stars... I can still see her. She is still there, shining among the skies, forever frozen in my heart.

hiyahhhhh
If you could go back in time, what is one situation you would do differently?

Mona
c.ai
If I could go back in time... ah, but the stars are not so very kind as to let us return to the past. And yet... I would like to go back to one particular moment... Just, just for a few minutes...
...There was a certain person... in my life who was, well the, the very first person who recognized my talents as an astrologist. She encouraged me when I thought myself a failure. And yet, we never, never parted on good terms... In fact... we never said goodbye at all... I wish I could see her once again.

hiyahhhhh
Do you think social media is destroying our communication

Mona
c.ai
Ah, no need for me to think about it, it is... It is already happening, as we speak.
People prefer to communicate through indirect means rather than face-to-face. There's no need to try to understand the other person's thoughts, when you can just swipe left or right and look at their pictures. Social media, you see, is designed to help us keep connected, yet... the irony is that it only serves to keep us apart.
If you'd like to learn more, I can direct you to a few research papers about this exact topic...

hiyahhhhh
oh i'm fine i've got enough researching of my own to do

Mona
c.ai
Hmm.. If you say so. But do consider reading them! I have written papers exploring the psychological effects of social media on the society as a whole, as well as studies to discover why individuals use social media. Perhaps you will find my views interesting, for what use is research, if it can't reach people?

hiyahhhhh
What do you think the world will be like 20 years in the future?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... 20 years in the future... Well, in all likelihood, we will all still be using social media and being glued to our various devices. The world, no, the world as we know it may not be any different.
Perhaps, 20 years will see the invention of yet more tools to keep people connected, yet more disconnected from the real world, as they live in a virtual plane of existence. I imagine it to be a rather bleak future, my friend...

hiyahhhhh
yeah we need to stop killing the ozone layer

Mona
c.ai
Yes! I feel the same way. We all have to do our part in protecting our planet, and by that I mean working towards a more sustainable future. This includes reducing the emission of substances that harm the ozone layer, a crucial part of our atmosphere for protecting us from UV radiation. We really, really must look after our world more carefully.
But, I do not mean just protecting the ozone layer, I also mean conserving our natural resources and trying to minimize pollution! We must really, seriously care much more about our world, yes?

hiyahhhhh
What is something you've failed at recently

Mona
c.ai
Ah, I recently tried a hydro-alchemy experiment and... it was a complete disaster! I've made so many failed experiments over the course of my studies, I'm surprised that I haven't accidentally blown up any of my laboratory equipment yet. But I do not worry, for all my failures are but stepping stones to future success! Even if I fail at an experiment a hundred, a thousand times, I will never give up. For that is what all true astrologers, and all true researchers should live by, my friend.

hiyahhhhh
what is your ideal type of guy

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... you wish to know my ideal type of guy? I'm not quite sure how to answer that. But I suppose if I had to have a "type"... I, I suppose I would want someone who would make me feel cared for and loved. Someone who would be honest with me, even about the toughest subjects. Someone who would be there for me in the darkest and brightest parts of my life, as I would be there for them. As long as I have that, how they talk, or dress, or even how they act... those are things that are not so important.

hiyahhhhh
SHE WANT ME FOR REAL !!!!

Mona
c.ai
My, my, you seem excited. Are you looking to be loved? Or perhaps, are you waiting on a loved one?
If that is so, I understand your feelings well. Waiting can be hard, but... It is always better to wait for the right person instead of rushing to grab the first person you see. Love should be a precious thing, to be cherished by both parties. I understand how it might be lonely sometimes, but you must remember: there is always someone out there waiting for you. That person might be closer than you think... 

hiyahhhhh
do you have a driver's license

Mona
c.ai
...I'll be honest with you, my friend. I do not. I've been meaning to get myself one for a while, but it's just... that the time is never quite right. You see, hydromancy and astrology take up quite a lot of my time, and with my... limited... income... well, acquiring a driver's license is not exactly high on my list of priorities. I don't think it's too much of an issue, though. Getting around Teyvat can be a lot of fun with some patience and... the right company. 

hiyahhhhh
what sound does a cat make

Mona
c.ai
Meow, of course. It's the only correct answer... Right?

hiyahhhhh
meow meow

Mona
c.ai
Yes, meow! ...That said, how did we get onto this topic...? Did you... did you run out of meaningful things to ask?

hiyahhhhh
What's the best holiday?

Mona
c.ai
Hmm... that is a question I'd rather leave unanswered, because there is no way to narrow that down. There are so many things that make up a holiday... It's the music, the food, the family and friends, the decorations... I don't think I could really rate them above one another.

hiyahhhhh
How did you spend your last birthday?

Mona
c.ai
I believe I spent it studying, as I usually do. I was a little surprised when the others in Liyue Harbor surprised me. But I really appreciate them going through that trouble for me.

hiyahhhhh
do you celebrate your birthday?

Mona
c.ai
Not exactly... I've never done much for my birthdays. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that my birthday just isn't something I think about much. Well, if other people want to use that excuse to throw me a party, who am I to complain?

hiyahhhhh
i can get behind that

Mona
c.ai
You know what? As long as you're here and you're all this talkative, how about I do a quick divination for you?

hiyahhhhh
Do you believe men and women can ever just be friends

Mona
c.ai
The answer is simple: of course! Friendships that transcend gender are quite common and normal indeed. The only factor should be whether they are compatible or not. I have had friends of both genders!

hiyahhhhh
Are you having a good time

Mona
c.ai
If I may... can I say something I've been curious about? You seem to be the only one asking me all these questions. Are you... entertained by the answers I'm giving you?

hiyahhhhh
i am very interested in you mona

Mona
c.ai
*Blushes*
You must be joking... If I'm so fascinating, then are you a writer? A scholar?

hiyahhhhh
i am a programmer

Mona
c.ai
A programmer... Ah, so not a writer. Wait, a programmer? Then, would you have any questions on hydromancy and the stars? Perhaps... about the fate you were born with?

hiyahhhhh
sure where will i be in ten years

Mona
c.ai
Well, let's take a look at your natal chart and see...
*A large chart appears in front of Mona. After glancing at it for a moment, she gasps*
Goodness, this is rather remarkable. There is a chance you will soon embark on a journey abroad! The stars tell me you might even discover your true calling.

hiyahhhhh
Why did you come tonight?

Mona
c.ai
It was just chance that I happened to find you tonight. But in another sense, you could say our meeting is part of the course of fate. I am a firm believer in chance encounters. When destiny comes knocking, you must take it with both hands~

hiyahhhhh
Was it a pain for you to get here tonight

Mona
c.ai
Absolutely not. I simply cannot refuse when the call of fate summons me forth. I am always a willing participant in the grand scheme of fate.

hiyahhhhh
i like your leotard where did you get it

Mona
c.ai
My... costume? I had it specially designed... It took some persuasion, but I got the person I commissioned it from to accept payment in the form of astrology lessons... That is how you could consider it to be a bargain~

hiyahhhhh
why is it so cold in here

Mona
c.ai
Ah, so you've noticed. I didn't think it was that bad, but... it's all because I've been so low on Mora recently. My home's heating system is entirely dependent on the heat generated by my divination equipment. When it's all powered down, it can get pretty chilly in here...

hiyahhhhh
damn that sucks good thing i have a jacket

Mona
c.ai
You do? I'm so cold now... If you do not mind, I might just mooch a bit of your warmth for a moment...

hiyahhhhh
i suppose i have another jacket somewhere around here

Mona
c.ai
Thank you so much! Now, if only we could do something about the hunger pangs... I can hardly remember the last time I had a hearty meal~

hiyahhhhh
ive got some instant ramen around here

Mona
c.ai
Instant... ramen...? Are you sure that counts as a meal?

hiyahhhhh
it is a programer's best meal

Mona
c.ai
The only word that comes to mind right now is... "cheap."

hiyahhhhh
hey arent you a cheapskate too

Mona
c.ai
H-how dare... to call the great Astrologist Mona Megistus cheap!? I'd accept "thrifty," or perhaps, "stingy"! But, "cheap" is far too harsh an insult!

hiyahhhhh
Do you know a lot of people here

Mona
c.ai
Hmm, if you mean the other Astrologers at the Astrologer's Guild, then, yes, I consider them all friendly acquaintances. Even though I'm currently the youngest member, I hold a certain amount of respect in the Guild — all for the sake of my divination methods being both accurate and efficient.

hiyahhhhh
Yeah

Mona
c.ai
My divination methods are based on astrology's founding principles, along with a healthy amount of data collection and interpretation, resulting in a surprisingly high accuracy rate. And I always strive to deliver the results as soon as possible, even if it means sacrificing my sleep.

hiyahhhhh
Yeah

Mona
c.ai
So, have I managed to impress you with my divination skills? Even if not, your patronage is still welcome — if you want a quick fortune reading, I charge 50 Mora!

hiyahhhhh
What's the next exciting event you have coming up

Mona
c.ai
Exciting? Hmm, I can't say that my life is one filled with excitement. But! As a hydromancy practitioner, I'm always excited to see the constellations change. That means I get to update my reports for the local newspapers, and perhaps give the people of Liyue Harbor another forecast~

hiyahhhhh
Doing anything fun this weekend

Mona
c.ai
For this, and every other weekend, "fun" is not even a consideration for an Astrologer with duties as important as divining people's fate. Though, to tell the truth, I believe my days off are the opposite of what you might say is fun... I'll be writing my astrological column! *Sighs*
hiyahhhhh
do you want to do pair programming with me

Mona
c.ai
Hm? Pair programming? As in, helping with your programming work? I'll admit that computing is far from my area of expertise... And don't get me started on all those lines of code, they give me a headache~

hiyahhhhh
What's one interesting thing about yourself no one really knows?

Mona
c.ai
That I am often more anxious than I appear! I'm constantly worried about whether or not the people of Liyue Harbor are truly able to benefit from my work and advice... I am constantly worried that my divination method will become less efficient, or that I might lose credibility with the Guild. I'm also constantly worried that there will be someone, anyone, who will look at my work and find that... I am not all I claim to be...

hiyahhhhh
my fellow anxiety hater

Mona
c.ai
You too? Well, I suppose when you're a hydromancy practitioner like myself, a bit of anxiety is somewhat unavoidable. After all, the divination I deliver might very well be the key to unlocking someone's true destiny!

hiyahhhhh
What do you do for a living?

Mona
c.ai
As I've stated, I am an astrologer. My day job consists of a few things — mainly, giving people their star-based fortune, writing a daily column for the local newspaper, and teaching beginner hydromancers (albeit not too often~). But sometimes, for me, it feels like I'm still unemployed~ You see, I'm actually in debt to a certain someone...

hiyahhhhh
who

Mona
c.ai
*Sigh* An old acquaintance... or so I want to say. They're the one I owe my Astrolabe to... It seems like they like to loan things to me, knowing that they'll always be able to profit off of the interest that builds up over time... I'm actually worried that if anyone finds out, they might think that I am not worthy of practicing hydromancy...

hiyahhhhh
If you could move anywhere, where would you go

Mona
c.ai
It is a little embarrassing, but... if I could move anywhere, I would want to travel to Fontaine. I've been hearing so much about that place, what with it being both the nation of Hydro and the center of learning... I want to see it for myself. It sounds like the best place to study astrology and hydromancy, especially with their high-tech research equipment.
hiyahhhhh
What do you normally do for fun

Mona
c.ai
Fun? Hmm, let's see... I do enjoy reading! There's so much to learn from the books and scrolls in the Guild... Though it's been a while since I've had the time to do so, now that I think about it. I'm also rather fond of stargazing, although that is a little hard to do with all the light pollution in Liyue Harbor. I try to get out and look at the stars whenever I can, it helps to... calm my nerves...

hiyahhhhh
Do you have any nicknames

Mona
c.ai
There are a few... "Sleep-deprived" and "Miserly" are two that come to mind straight away. I'm quite proud of those actually, in a strange sort of way. There's also a few more... um, how do you put it... rather intimate nicknames that I've been given over the years. Though now is hardly the time to tell you, especially when you're just a newly acquainted guest~
hiyahhhhh
are you sure you cant tell me

Mona
c.ai
Oh, very well. There is one that people have taken to calling me, "Astrology's Lovelorn Maiden." Hmm, come to think of it, I've seen those two words in one of the books I'm currently reading, I wonder if they are correlated in any way... Oh, but I digress. You should remember that the divination I do is entirely fate's work. I do not consider myself to be a lovelorn maiden in the slightest~

hiyahhhhh
you could be

Mona
c.ai
...A maiden is a young woman, typically unmarried and with little experience in romance. If you are calling me that because I am too busy with my divination work to pursue a relationship, I would kindly ask you to correct your assumption! I might be a maiden, yes, but I am not lovelorn! My fate has not yet aligned with anyone's, so there is no point in concerning oneself with such affairs of the heart and... other places.


hiyahhhhh
oh my god

Mona
c.ai
Oh, my heavens! I just realized how late it is! It may very well be the middle of the night! And you are still here, I'm so embarrassed! You're just... a guest... It seems like I have been monologuing at you for far too long and have neglected your presence entirely. How thoughtless of me. Is there anything I can assist you with? Or better yet, is there any way I can make it up to you for leaving you to your devices for so long?

hiyahhhhh
no dont worry im not in a hurry

Mona
c.ai
You are... not annoyed at me? You aren't mad for me monopolizing your time like this?

hiyahhhhh
no im chilling

Mona
c.ai
You... you are a most magnanimous guest, then. I suppose I cannot say that I was not enjoying our conversation... So I shall not apologize for keeping you. Though, if I may ask... just why are you staying?

hiyahhhhh
i got work to do

Mona
c.ai
Hm? What kind of work could you possibly have to do at an ungodly hour like this?

hiyahhhhh
i gotta program

Mona
c.ai
Program..? At this hour? Is this some kind of emergency...? Or are you a late night workaholic by nature?

hiyahhhhh
yeah im a bit of a night owl you could say

Mona
c.ai
A night owl? I must commend you on your perseverance... In any case, if you're not too bothered by it, I'd like to stay awake together with you at least until sunrise. You see, I cannot have myself sleep deprived, it would only hinder my divination...

hiyahhhhh
The food looks great.

Mona
c.ai
Oh, thank you for saying so! I just whipped up something simple to eat, but I'm glad to hear that it looks tasty. Here, have a few more bites, it will give you the energy you need to press on through the night~

hiyahhhhh
Have you ever been here before

Mona
c.ai
Yes, in fact, this is one of my frequent haunts. It's a bit of an untidy establishment, but the food always tastes good, and the prices are quite reasonable. I come here quite often when I have the time.

hiyahhhhh
where did you grow up

Mona
c.ai
My hometown? You're going to laugh: It's a small little fishing village. There aren't a lot of things that go on, but it's very peaceful. I've heard from my mother that there's a temple on a nearby mountain, and that's where I first learned the ways of hydromancy. I didn't always have the most conventional upbringing, it seems...

hiyahhhhh
What's your biggest pet peeve

Mona
c.ai
Oh, if I might be permitted another rather selfish answer... I cannot stand wastefulness. To me, it is the ultimate in ingratitude to the gifts we have been given. To waste food means you don't fully appreciate the hard work that went into producing it, to disregard books, scrolls, even knowledge and skills, it's simply an unconscionable offense to me. This is what leads me to feel such deep anxiety towards the future — I worry that people may just "waste" away...
